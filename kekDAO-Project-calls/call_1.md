## Intro

**Mark:** Welcome everyone to project call number one! For kekDAO & Universe. We are excited to be here with you today and start talking about one of our new projects‚Äì The kekDAO. And what we plan to do.

I'll start by letting Tyler provide a grand overview of Universe and how everything is interconnected.

### Universe üåå

#### [Tyler Ward](https://twitter.com/LordTylerWard)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Tyler:**  Universe and kekDAO stem off some of the work with NFTs going back about 30-45 days ago. It's not singularly my idea. It's a conglomeration of ideas that the group of us on this call had together. When we worked on NFP, we ran into issues with everything from minting, on-chain metadata and finding an effective auction platform. 

As we were launched that project, everyone on this call ended up working on components toward building kekDAO and Non-Fungible Universe. We also have a brain trust with numerous people original to the project, consisting of prolific investors, DeFi/NFT developers and project managers. We went back and forth on what we wanted to build with that 'brain trust' as we call it. Essentially, we settled on building out an effective platform that artists can go to, run auctions and have collections. 

Separate from that. Tim has also worked in the NFT space for a considerable length of time. A ton of people deep in the NFT space know he is a large-scale investor in projects. Tim has had quite a few difficulties displaying his collection and working with artists. I know that Justin Blau (3LAU) had some issues with some of the auctions he was running. We are taking that workflow and funnelling it into a lot of what we have been building the last few months.

Separate from all of that is where it becomes a conglomeration of ideas. Ryan, who is on this call, and runs a lot of the project management for dev, was original to NFP. We had him build some gaming functionalities.  Then we realized he was a pretty incredible developer‚Äì hiding‚Äì a scarce asset in crypto right now. 


With that said. At a high level, Troy and less so myself have been looking a lot into decentralized media. That's where I met Dragos and the D-Mob team. We had basically looked down the rabbit hole of file coin and how we can decentralize user interfaces. More for DeFi and BarnBridge, but as you fast forward, we now have a platform and launchpad‚Äì where we can build out our long-term ideas. We basically decided to merge the efforts.

There were talks between Dfinity and several groups like Fleek‚Äì by [Harrison Hines](https://twitter.com/harris0nhines)‚Äì who I worked with. And Harrison and I started token forge when I was at Consensys.  We brought him on as an advisor. The overall point is we build all of this into one interface with a social network catch-all, where people interact. Tim and his designers can easily display their collections. A place where people can easily mint and auction art. 

It will live at the intersection of DeFi and NFTs‚Äì which will be a problem for platforms like OpenSea. We want to work very hard, so the interface level and not only smart contracts are decentralized. We merged all this together into a protocol called 'Universe' or Non-Fungible Universe. It's also referred to as Universe.xyz because that's the domain. However, it's all powered by kekDAO‚Äì a modified fork of the BarnBridge DAO. Lime Chain‚Äì who is also on this call, helped build Bond Bet. So, we decided to segment out a lot of the dev work.

So, that's a roundabout of how this came up. And what we've been doing the last few months. I'm unsure of when we transitioned everything over to Non-Fungible Universe. What Universe looks like at scale and at aggregate‚ÄìIf we can pull this off. It's a place for artists and communities to interact with each other, similar to a social network. People can also build things on top of that network and community that they have created, with a base layer interface that is fully decentralized and powered, ideally, by Dfinity. All of the financial components and base layer settlement will be handled via DAO on Ethereum. 

So, that's very much a long-term vision. The majority of what has happened and transpired over the past ninety days kickstarted us towards this project now. Through this framework, It's a conglomeration of a lot of ideas. It's nothing that was solely mine. We are all working on this together to make it come true. Troy can talk more in-depth on this call than I can about decentralized media and Dfinity. That's one of the more compelling aspects of this project that's different. Compared to the other fundraisers. For example, OpenSea raised 25 million. I think we are the only group focused on this interface stuff. 

That's my ted talk. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Awesome, thank you, Tyler. I appreciate it.

Let's slide right into introductions. I wanted Tyler to give a quick overview. So, we didn't lose anyone.

We want everyone to know what the call is about.

## Team Introductions
**Mark:** I'll go ahead and start off.

#### [Mark Ward](https://twitter.com/markwardbro)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** My name is Mark. I've worked for BarnBridge for the last five months. I started working for Tyler about a year and a half ago. For Proof Systems. I'm kind of Tyler's helper. I try and help out as much as I can. I do whatever I can do to help out. Whatever needs to be accomplished, I work to get it done. I work with Pavlo most of the time‚Äì all the time. Basically, we work together to complete tasks and reach goals.

I wouldn't say we have a specific job title anymore, but we would consider ourselves, get shit doner's. That's just kind of how it is in crypto. There is something new every day. It keeps you on your toes and excited. So, we really love it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Who would like to go next?

**Troy:** I think Tim should go next.

#### Tim Kang ([@illestrater_](https://twitter.com/illestrater_?lang=en))
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Tim:** I'm Tim Kang. I got into NFTs a bit ago. I may be known for collecting a lot. But, I have a background in software engineering. I've been working on a live streaming platform for a couple years. However, I put that on the back burner for a while. As I focus majorly on NFTs. 

Also, I'm building a grants program‚Äì it's a charity ‚Äìintended to help artists get into NFTs and other things. It's something I'm excited about. A lot of the work I'm doing there goes in tandem with providing some infrastructure for NFU.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Sweet!

**Troy:** Uh, cool, I'll go next. üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### [Troy Murray](https://twitter.com/Danny_Desert)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Troy:** I'm Troy Murray. I'm terrible at intros like this‚Äì I'll try and wing it.

You might probably know me from BarnBridge. I've been working with Tyler and the DMOB team for around 2 and 3 years, respectively. We were working around decentralized media before this. (before our DeFi work)

I've always had some problems with NFTs and where the content value is stored. It's not very decentralized. So, I've been quite skeptical of them. Although, I think we have a team here that can put this together and change how the industry operates for the better‚Äì in my opinion. I'm really excited about the stuff we are exploring and designing. I think it will fix some of those problems and concerns that I personally had. Everyone is pretty focused on that.

There's my talk. That's my intro.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Whoever wants to go next. 

**Tyler:** I'll tack on to that. 

For Troy and Tim. They are humble. Tim is also known as Illestrater_ I think anyone can look him up. He's a badass. But, people are humble. Also, Troy has worked in decentralized media for a considerable length of time. And so has Tim. He has built a live music streaming app. And also has a lot of deep connections with high-end artists. Tons of people respect him as a leader and an influencer in the NFT space. He is very much our beacon for making sure we do this right on the NFT side. 

I would also say. Troy is equally that on the media side. He has a deep understanding of how media works in crypto‚Äì everything from the platforms to the architecture to the compensation for artists. I needed to speak on their behalf a bit because they are humble.

**Mark:** Yeah, when we completely empower artists and have a platform that gives back. Tim will be the one to thank‚Äì he pushed. He honestly gave us several ideas to make this truly community lead and empowering‚Äì a majority of these people. Making it about the artist and not about 'NFTs' and the resales. 

**Tim:** I'm fighting for you all! I got you!ü¶æüòäüé®

**Tyler:** I'll say that Troy did that too. It's very equal.

**Tim:** Yes, absolutely. üôè

**Tyler:** Our platform would not be as architected for artists as it is‚Äì if it wasn't for Troy and Tim. But, I'll shut up and let everybody else introduce themselves. 

#### Ryan Shtirmer
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ryan:** I'm Ryan Shtirmer. I've been in the Ethereum space for a couple years now‚Äì playing around. It's been heads-down focused on all of this with everyone. It's exciting. I'm operating as the product owner here. In some ways, I'm managing expectations on both sides. The goal is to build this platform out as best as we can. For both creators and users, bidding on NFTs. 

I'm working closely with Tim, Troy, Mark, Pavlo and the brilliant devs from Lime Chain. To build this all together‚Äì it's super exciting.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Dragos, do you want to go next?

King Dragos?

**Dragos:** Yeah, sure.

#### [Dragos Rizescu](https://twitter.com/DragosRizescu)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Dragos:** Hello, everyone! üëã

My name is Dragos. Dragos Rizescu. 

I made that joke with the BarnBridge stuff. 

Anyway, I'm part of DMOB, I'm in charge of making products. My background is in software development. I've been in the crypto ecosystem for around five years‚Äì more than five years now. I met Tyler and Troy a long time ago. We are here to support the web3 stuff for this project.

That's my short intro.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Now Pavlo.

**Dragos:** Hold on, Cezar, do you want to follow up? Since we are pretty much brothers here.

**Mark:** Oh, Cezar!

#### [Cezar Paraschiv](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cezarparaschiv)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Cezar:** Hi guys, I'm Cezar. 

I'm the project manager, I'm part of the DMOB team. I joined the blockchain space in 2016. I also have experience in decentralized media. I worked with Troy for a long time, and I look forward to building this product.

That's my short introduction.

Thanks!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Awesome, we are glad to have you, Cezar!

Pavlo, would you like to go next?

#### [Pavlo Bendus](https://twitter.com/p_bendus)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Pavlo:** My name is Pavlo Bendus. 

I'm based in Ukraine. I originally started software engineering but got engaged more in product marketing and management areas. I ran a small logo marketing agency. Then I was involved with Tyler and Proof Systems. We ran marketing and ads management for a lot of different companies‚Äì mainly blockchain companies. Then I got involved with BarnBridge, which eventually led me deeply into DeFi. Now I am trying to help coordinate the front end and design activities. As well as product management.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Yeah, Pavlo is a one-man army. I don't know what I would do without him. And Dmytro is also a one-man army. He'll introduce himself‚Äì Dima is behind the majority of the kekDAO & Universe designs.

He is also quite humble, so I'm going to hype him up. Deema is an unbelievable artist and designer. He has probably made more websites for crypto companies than the average human being. And every time, he crushes it. I really can't wait to launch the site so everyone can see it. 

I'll let Deema introduce himself. 

#### [Dmytro Dutka](https://twitter.com/dimadutka)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Dmytro:** Hi there! Thank you, Mark. 

My name is Dmytro. I'm the UX/UI and branded entity designer‚Äì with more than eight years of experience. I like to take ideas and goals then bring them to life, with a visual medium, to create something unique. At the same time, I always try and focus on the user. This allows me to make useful designs. I've been working with Tyler for around three years now. On various fin-tech, DeFi and crypto projects. I'm happy to be here in the kekDAO. 

That's it, thank you!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Awesome, thanks, Dmytro.

**Tyler:** Wait, let me tack on for Deema.

First of all, Deema is one of the best designers I have ever met. Dennis from BarnBridge is unbelievable as well. However, I've worked with Deema for a very long time. I think Marks right Deema has probably made more logos and branding packages for blockchain companies than anyone I've ever met.

But, the reason I wanted to chime in on Deema‚Äì is because I have another company, Proof Systems. (one of the large UI/UX shops in crypto) 

A critical reason we can bootstrap this project‚Äì without creating a major distraction to BarnBridge‚Äì is because I'm shutting Proof Systems down. Now that we have closed that round.

Deema has numerous designers around him, and there will be others who join this call in the future‚Äì they will be splitting time between the two projects at the moment and are slowly moving over. Like Herbert, he will be helpful. We have a few project managers‚Äì I'm not sure how many of these people will be on these calls. 

There are at least five to ten people behind Deema helping him execute a lot of these ideas. Including react developers, project managers and designers. So, when you see everything that comes out‚Äì Deema has a team behind him, and he is at the top of the chain, ensuring quality.

**Mark:** It's going to be A-Quality. It's going to be good.

Alright, Ilia, would you like to introduce the Lime Chain team?

#### [LimeChain Team](https://twitter.com/LimeChainHQ)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Iliya:** Maybe Zhivko can start with a better version of our intro, and then we can all introduce ourselves better.

You are muted.

#### [Zhivko Todorov](https://twitter.com/zhivkoto)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Zhivko:** What a way to put me on the spot, I said. üòÜ

I'm Zhivko, but everyone calls me 'Z' because it's a complicated Slavic name. We are Lime Chain‚Äì we are builders and a dev shop. We have been building dApps and blockchain infrastructure since early 2017. Initially, we started working with the BarnBridge team on Bond Bet‚Äì late last year.  

Now, we are super excited to be a part of the Non-fungible Universe, where we are mainly focused on building out the solidity.  

Now I'll leave it to Ilia and the rest of the team to introduce themselves.

#### Iliya Andreev 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Iliya:** My name is Iliya Andreev. I've been in the software world for about eight years now. I've been mostly a Q/A and team lead. I naturally progressed to the project major for Lime Chain around a year and a half ago. I help Stanislav focus on the developer stuff while building something great. 

It's a pleasure to be here and working with all of you guys.

#### [Stanislav Trenev](https://twitter.com/sstrenev)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Stanislav:** Hi guys, I'm Stan.

I'm a solidity dev from the Lime Chain team. Previously I worked on the smart contracts for Bond Bet. And now we are working on the auction side for Non-fungible Universe. 

I'm looking forward to working with you all!

#### [Andon Mitev](https://twitter.com/mitev_andon)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Andon:** Hi guys!

My name is Andon! They call me Andy for short. 

I've been working for Lime Chain for a few months now. I've been in the blockchain space for two or three years. I have previous experience with cross-chain atomic swaps for decentralized exchange. I also have experience as a full-stack developer, and right now, my focus is on the solidity for the auctions.   

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Thanks, Andy. 

Yeah, the Lime Chain guys are doing most of everything on the back-end. I don't know a ton about coding, but I can see that they have already finished some of the auction contracts‚Äì critical to what we are building. It's exciting that it's already coming along. We are in motion. As Tyler said, we have only been working on this for around 60 days or maybe only 50. 

Let me let Al and Nick introduce themselves‚Äì I've saved the best for last.

#### [Algernon Holmes](https://twitter.com/youngalgy)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Alex:** Hey, there guys!

My name is Alex. I basically do whatever Tyler wants me to do. Currently, I'm working on character lore. Creating stories for each of the 69 characters. One of the artists and I have been working on comics. Hopefully, later on, they are finished faster‚Äì once all the characters have been created. My background is in psychology. I have a large amount of experience managing artists‚Äì and writing. I've always enjoyed writing stories. I have over a hundred songs written. 

Right now, I'm focused on character lore, and that's my main thing for NFU.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** This is Nick. He is also working on character lore and working on wherever he can. He's been helping out on some of the designs. 

I'll let Nick introduce himself. 


#### [Nick Ward](https://twitter.com/NickAwkWard)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Nick:** What up, guys! I'm Nick.

Brother of Mark and Tyler‚Äì if you didn't know.  Right now, I'm working mainly on the characters and the NFT development. I've been working with Dmytro regarding how the NFTs will work. I've also been working on the comics and writing down a few stories and ideas. I'm also a get shit done'r and one of Tyler's lackeys. We just do whatever, you know?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mark:** Alright, I think that's everybody. We'll give Milad a shoutout. He's not here. I believe he is in charge of DMOB‚Äì he is the main guy. 

Milad's a beast.

**Tyler:** Call him in. He's there. He's behind Cezar. 

**Mark:** Milad, would you like to introduce yourself, or no?

It looks like he does not want to introduce himself. Milad's waving back there.

**Milad:** üëãüëãüëãüëã

**Mark:** Milad is one of the main devs at DMOB that helped architect the BarnBridge DAO‚Äì which we will be forking. We'll talk about that on later calls as we near it on the roadmap. 

I do want to talk about the characters because I don't think Tyler discussed it. Al and Nick did mention them.

## NFU Characters

**Mark:** So, as an NFT project, we are creating infrastructure‚Äì a sort of NFT ecosystem‚Äì with social auctions. People can interact with each other and make short films. There will be decentralized media where you can easily create content like comics. Any type of media you would like to create‚Äì kekDAO will allow you to do that. 

Essentially, we are going to lay the groundwork and create the tools. We will allow anyone to use these tools. Similar to how I view OpenSea, it's a tool. We are giving you guys these tools, and we'll lay the groundwork with an original character launch‚Äì there are 69 characters launched under the kekDAO. From there, we create comics and stories and short films. Whatever anyone wants us to do and make for these characters‚Äì we will do it to show you the power of the platform. 

Really, the main goal is a decentralized Disney, where you can create characters and then develop them further. We can take advantage of the popularity of characters and improve them further, putting them in more stories or movies. So, if that character is popular, then it potentially becomes a Mickey Mouse scenario. It originated as a drawing, and now we have a giant media company named Disney that owns everything.

I think the interesting thing here‚Äì we are starting with NFTs and pictures. But we are looking into what legitimate financial, gaming and decentralized technology we can apply to this. While doing it, we want to display the capabilities of the platform. That's why we want to create 69 characters. 

We will let you know more about them. There are a bunch done already. Ends still need to be closed off‚Äì how they will be released. We are leaning towards a bonding curve. I know a lot of people like bonding curves with NFTs. I'll just leave it at that. 

I'm going to move over. 

### kekDAO & Universe: Content

**Tyler:** Hey, I want to clarify one or two things from the legal side. As we start to make announcements. 

> I'll try not to interrupt as much on future calls. 

There are basically two types of drops on the platform. One where artists can come in and launch collections. Similar to the 3LAU drop with tiers. Artists can set a reserve for the auction‚Äì very similar to 3LAU's. All the proceeds from those drops go to the artists. So, the platform does not take any fees from that.

So, that's what core drops are for‚Äì in my opinion‚Äì because several low-effort drops keep appearing in the ecosystem. We are almost in the DeFi summer of last year, where projects like YAM were getting copy-pasted. Until the legit guts that got developed started to release‚Äì making people excited about DeFi again. NFTs are going through that too, there are so many pixel projects dropping. It's becoming slightly redundant. Everyone is producing a version of Punks.

High-effort projects are getting built. They have not been released because they are high effort, and they take longer. And what we are doing with kekDAO is working on projects that take a lot of time, development and code. Then we are releasing them into the ecosystem. I'll also say one thing about us that separates us from a 'decentralized Disney.' The kekDAO doesn't own the character's IP. They will all be creative commons, and the drops will be completely open-source.

Some of the problems I ran into with Pepe‚Äì I did not know that he had a creator. I think everyone knows how it went. I'm not going into it further for legal reasons. 

Any character we create can be used anywhere. If someone wants to make a meme from it‚Äì so long as no racism, bigotry or illegal/otherwise obscene derivatives. Other than that, these characters are creative commons. People can use them for other drops on the platform. Artists can use them for art. As well as the software coded for these drops. Whether we build bonding curves‚Äì or another project, we are doing 'Polymorphic KeK.'  All of that stuff will be open-source for others to build with and on in the future. 

We hope that our efforts to build out this framework and pathway for others to create better drops. So we don't see copypaste Punks across NFTs for the next ten years. 

That's one thing I needed to clarify on the initial call for the lawyers. 

**Mark:** Also, to clarify further, it's our stuff on the platform that is creative commons. If you have copyrighted work and you would like to launch it on our platform‚Äì if you have the rights, then that's different. 

However, everything by KeKDAO is creative commons. You guys can do whatever you want to do with it‚Äì granted, it falls within Tyler's means. 

It doesn't mean that everything on KeKDAO is creative commons. If you have copyrighted work, when you launch it, it's your responsibility.

**Tyler:** Yes, any off-chain stuff that you want to handle. If you launch something on KeKDAO. Or you have a company with clients you have to figure out the IP stuff by yourself. That's your off-chain legal requirements‚Äì we are a DAO. We do not have any legal structure. And we don't own any IP for the things that we are working on. However, other people who launch projects on the platform are fine‚Äì it's a different story. 

Separating this out, we have drops coming in from other people and other artists that Tim and Justin will be bringing in. On the other hand, there are core drops that we will build, and those are creative commons and open-source. 

Good point on clarifying that.  

**Mark:** I think Tyler has hit on a bunch of the auction stuff. I'm unsure if Tim needs to expand on it much. One thing I would like to add‚Äì there will be multiple types of auctions. 

It won't be one style of auction like 3LAU. There will be singles that you can mint and auction off as well. We didn't want to limit people to that feature of slots and tiers. 

Tim, is there anything you would like to add about the auctions?

I think the main point about the auctions‚Äì we want to give 100% to artists on their launches. That was something that Tim really pushed for, saying it was something that would truly empower artists. Tim, I'm not sure if you want to talk about that or the auctions specifically.

**Tim:** The auctions were inspired by Justin Blau's auction mechanic on KnownOrigin. There are a lot more benefits to a decentralized system. Also, there is a lack of decentralized auctions in general. So, we hope to provide a framework that completely empowers artists and creators. Because we are not taking anything from this. We want it to be free to use, and it helps push the space forward. 

**Mark:** We hope these are tools that everyone learns to use. That they become something that everyone does. Whether it is building a community with our social, minting NFTs with our minting function, making character lore or releasing your comic book via a bonding curve for the characters you've made. The possibilities of what we are doing are endless. I'm getting excited about it. I'm not going to talk much about the galleries and social because we are running out of time. 

Troy, can you go over some of the decentralized media stuff. Some of the stuff that we will be utilizing. And what that will look like. 

**Troy:** I don't want to dive too deeply into that stuff yet‚Äì it's a bit up in the air. It has not been finalized with the lawyers yet on how we accomplish this. Just know, we will be using cutting-edge technology that empowers artists. It also enables the art they create inside new systems that are fully decentralized‚Äì all the way to the UI. 

That will get interesting as we flesh it out. I don't want to get into that right now because that is like pandora's box. Ideally, by the next call, I can talk about it. I have meetings with lawyers later today about this.

I think one thing that I've been very impressed by‚Äì tacked on to what Tim was saying. We are not tacking fees onto the auctions, so people wonder how the DAO will accrue fees. We have come up with some innovative second-hand services around that‚Äì that we build into. These products will accrue fees. On a basic level, I think people will find our innovations interesting. 

The core does not take fees, but the additional components around do in some way. I'm interested to see how that plays out. Tim was very much a maximalist for that, and I respect it. 

**Mark:** Yeah, I agree. That is something that will really set us apart. Giving one hundred percent to an artist for launching an NFT drop. I don't think that exists. I think that's exciting. I'm super excited about this entire project. 
We have one last thing to talk about, and that's the KeKDAO. And what we are going to do.

## kekDAO

**Mark:** I'll let Tyler and Dragos talk about this more.  On a basic level, we are going to fork the BarnBridge DAO. I believe we will have yield farming. Although, I'm not sure about the pools and the direct similarities to BarnBridge.

 Some of it will be different. I think Tyler and Dragos will want to pick this up and explain more about it. Right now, we have an EdenDAO‚Äì our launch DAO, and that will seed the kekDAO. 

**Tyler:** Dragos, do you want to take this? Or would you like me to?

After our call yesterday, I talked to Milad via DMs about this. I'm not sure how much of that got back to you. You're more than welcome to take this, but I don't know if you want to. 

**Dragos:** I think we should release more details about this next project call. I'm aware of the changes to pool one and what tokens we will be using. However, I'm thinking we should make sure we hash out all the details first. That's my feedback on it‚Äì but, I'm happy to speak about it. 

**Tyler:** I completely agree. Just so the community knows. We raised around 4.4 million dollars‚Äì in a round. It was completely separate from all of the Non-Fungible Pepe. It's been shut down, it no longer exists, and all the money has been returned.

This is an entirely new entity. We are doing this community call ahead of the fact. The reason details are hazy on some of these things is. Because we have not finalized certain conditions with the lawyers‚Äî which we need to make formal announcements. All of the token breakdowns, the cuts, are still in flux. We are around 90% there, where nothing should change drastically. 

Everything I said on that Discord call‚Äì everyone was a part of it. We are still doing the community drop for people active in the Discord‚Äì those bots are still there. We are still allocating tokens for people who bid on  NFPs but less so than originally planned because we refunded so many of them. Also, a community discretionary drop. That was to be 36 people has now grown to 52 people. So, we have increased the allocation for that. The project's goal is for this to be community-run. There are around 2-3 hundred people directly helping and then around thousands of people getting the community drop. Because there are 2000 in our community Discord. 

So, when people see the actual cuts, they are more weighted towards the team and original community investors. (let's say BarnBridge) 

The reason is that with BarnBridge, it was 10-15 people/entities, and this time it's closer to a hundred and possibly thousands of contributors. We are making sure this token gets distributed and that community governance kicks in as fast as possible. But, we still have to finalize this stuff before we make announcements. We are forking a lot from BarnBridge. But, there will be differences around how yield-farming works.  

One key difference, instead of pool one being USDC, sUSD and DAI‚Äì original to the Smart yield product. This time it's very much about community. So, it will likely be a basket of tokens whose communities have helped us along the way. Those are going to be the staking tokens for the different pools. But, those are also the details we are still hammering out. 

So, by the time we have this call, two weeks from now. We will have made formal announcements, and some of those cuts will have been solidified in stone. Naturally, after that, they are on the blockchain, and nobody can change them. 

**Mark:** Thanks, Tyler.

Tyler sent me a note. I messed up earlier explaining something in the call. 

*The Lime Chain guys are doing the Smart contract work and not the back-end development.* That's the DMOB guys doing all the back-end development.*

I think everyone gets it. Also, I believe that is everything for this call. 

Thank you, everyone! We'll see you in two weeks for the next project call. 

Does anyone have anything to say?

## Future

**Troy:**  I guess, Tyler, I have a question. 

When are we releasing the docs? That's the question. 

**Tyler:** We talk to Doug, our attorney, tomorrow. One thing I will say. For anyone who has been following along. We have cut out a lot of the financial stuff in the docs‚Äì topics centred around fractionalized NFTs and how it would work. I don't believe any core drops will be playing around with that. 

The future calls will be a lot more organized. Mark, you actually crushed this call, running it. Because there is nothing written down for anybody but me, Tim, Dragos and Troy. But we have final sign-off on a call‚Äì with our attorney to make sure everything we say is legal before we pull the trigger. 

So, I would say once we talk to Doug‚Äì I'll be in Puerto Rico. But I can finalize a lot of those docs by next week, work with the team and then we can start to make announcements. So, by the time we are on the call two weeks from today, people will have a lot more insight into what exactly is going on as we start to hammer out timelines. We prioritized the auction and minting stuff ahead of the DAO and token release. Because of the demand in the NFT space right now. But all of that stuff is coming. 

Hopefully, that answers your question, Troy.

**Troy:** I was kind of playing on the joke. 

Because if you were in the early NFP stuff, the community always asked: "when are the docs were coming?" üê∏‚òï

**Tyler:** I also told the community that the silent period was over as of last week‚Äì but it will probably be next week. 

The docs are coming. üòÇ

**Troy:** üòÇüòÇüòÇ

**Mark:** Hopefully, we will have the website up, with the docs, next week. It should be done. It's right there. 

Alright, guys! I think this was successful, and we can end this. 

Join us again in two weeks on Thursday at 10AM‚Äì if there are any changes for the time, It'll be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kekdao). I'll let everyone know. 

I'm also going to be posting these calls on the kekDAO repo and Twitter.

Please, retweet, share, subscribe, all the stuff! 

Thank you, guys!

**Troy:** Have a good one, everybody!

**Everyone:** üëãüëãüëãüëã
