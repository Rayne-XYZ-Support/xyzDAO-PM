## Intro

**Ryan:** All right. Well, I'll jump in.

**Mark:** I didn't know I was muted. I was looking at something. If you want to start Chuba, go right ahead. 

**Ryan:** So I guess, first and foremost, I just want to thank everyone on the Universe team for all the incredible work this last year and especially this last month. For the last two months doing everything they possibly can to launch the Marketplace. That's just been incredible. The craziness internationally and everything else going on. Is there a little bit of feedback coming from somewhere? It's gone now. So we put up a forum, thanks to Transmental, where we've aggregated a bunch of AMA questions in. I still think we do have the channel opened in here. So if you do want to post questions in there, that's okay. But going forward, we'd appreciate people aggregating the questions into the forum as much as possible so that there can be some discussion on these things with the community before we go and comment on them on the community calls. So I don't know if we want to jump into questions.

## Updates

**Ryan:** Let me give a few updates on what's coming first. So right now, we have two planned releases that we are working on. The 1st is version 1.01, and then version 1.1. So the 1st version you guys are going to see will have a bunch of hotfixes, bug fixes things like the ledger issue.

Let me see if I can read off 1 or 2 more things. Then in the new version 1.1, hopefully coming very soon. You're going to see the ability to share Universe links across social media platforms, Discord, and send links to other people. Along with other optimizations in that domain. We're looking to get some of the other major improvements ASAP; there will be 1 to 2 sprints before these are out or things like 1155 support. So there's a lot of stuff in the works, the order migration, bulk listings. It's going to have to come with each feature release. So we will keep you guys posted on that. We'll try to aggregate some information on some specific features that are actively being worked on, so you guys can then take a look at them. We can probably jump into questions now. 

**Mark:** To add to what Chuba is saying. We have been listening to the community about communication. Do you guys want a little more transparency about, What's going on? What we're currently working on? What features are coming? So we will be; I think we will either start posting a weekly or a bi-weekly medium. It's just the progress we've made: the current week or time frame. Then what is to be expected from the following brand. That's not always to say that we are going to get those things done. If we post it one week, say we're working on this other thing next week, it doesn't always mean we're going to knock it out in a week. But we are going to try to be a lot more transparent and communicate because it seems that's what the community is asking the most from us and the team. We hear you guys, and we're going to work on that.

## Forum Questions ?

### **Question:**
I'll start reading some questions and start with the forum. So first is JD Buffalo, Who asks not sure the best way to ask, but he's interested in, What the team has learned from some of the back and forth? 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** Well, on the communication question and a lot of the issues there, I think that goes partly to what Mark addresses there. I'm not going to read the second part of this comment. It's very concerned with the Token price. I believe that the focus and emphasis on the energy should be spent on building a healthy Universe protocol. What that means to me is working towards increasing listings on the platform. Increasing matches and sales on the forum, increasing the number of users who go to the website every day its metrics. When all of these things grow, you can come to your conclusions. The most important thing to the Universe ecosystem is the growth and health of the product. I think everything else is, I don't want to say tertiary, but it's not what needs to be the priority because it's existential that the Marketplace is used and accurate fees and continues to grow.

Without growth, there is nothing. Even if the token price is up or down, it's meaningless without a booming ecosystem in the Universe protocol. Okay, enough about Token Price. 

### **Question:**

Can we work with Gem to make the Universe brand more prominent in the listings? 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** OpenSea and Looks pop Universe fades in the background. So I saw this question yesterday. Transmental has sourced the icon for the one that will stand out and be prominent. We're going to send that over to the Gem guys today and then to Genie when we get integrated with them soon. 

### **Question:**

Thoughts on 2 product updates changes. What do you guys think? 
1. Contract checks checkbox before check out. 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** The core idea was when a user goes to buy a contract or buy a token. We give them some links on verifying that they are buying the actual contract and maybe click a check box or sign a message saying that they have verified it 
A. To educate the community and 
B. Potentially some legal coverage, though. I don't know whether that is material or not. I'm not a lawyer.

Then another idea he discusses is, 
2. Premium priority payments for projects? 

**Ryan:** This idea would be something like prioritized listings. That may be if you take XYZ, you get a priority listing, or if you pay extra to the DAO, you get a priority listing. I'm not sure how I feel about that one, but it's a DAO. Post your responses in the form, and we'll see if that's an idea that latches on. There's too much supply.

### **Question:**

Another token price question. 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** I think the additional part of that is backlinks to videos on how to check contracts. I don't know if there are any really good resources, but I know we can put some in the other.

**Mark:** I think this is because of my comment last week. We need to learn better security in the space, check the contracts, and learn to verify contract addresses. Our team, especially Rayne, has even said he's going to try to make a video so that you can teach people how to verify that contract address. It has a place in the docs, and we can add those things. I don't think it's good UX or great UI to have a video in a checkout. Maybe create a short little course that you have to go through the Universe course when you first connect your wallet. I don't know. I think there are ways that we could do that, but I don't want to distract us from the Marketplace to make something like that. We definitely can make videos. I'm just saying it would be annoying if a video popped up on a checkout screen.

**Ryan:** I think we can style it elegantly because the questions are about tokenomics; I want to address that. We are internally reviewing the tokenomics and potential incentives for the full Marketplace Launch. I can't give details or specifics on what that may or may not look like. It's an ongoing legal process that involves making sure that everything is entirely above board. We do understand that it is something that is frequently discussed. The tokenics questions, and we'll hope to be able to provide more clear-cut answers as we get them. There is a big focus on that. Ensure all the incentives are aligned and that the incentives may exist in the future work towards increasing the health of the Universe Marketplace. The growth of the Marketplace, the liquidity, the number of matches on it, the number of users, and all the other metrics we may care about.

## Shoutout:

**Rayne:** Oh, sorry, it's Rayne. But shout out to Smalltime. He made a video for us about how to check contracts, so I'll link to that in the Pre AMA channel, and I'll put it on the forum too.

**Ryan:** Appreciate it, sir. We don't have any more forum questions, but the Pre AMA is still open, so you guys can post anything that you may want to ask. I don't know if any of the other speakers on the panel have any thoughts on this premium priority payment stuff. I don't know if that has much support. The author seems ecstatic about it, so I'm not sure we need to give it too much daylight, but I'm just trying to hone in on some community discussions.

**Mark:** My comment is that we probably shouldn't do it. I don't think it's centralized if you can make it a decentralized decision if we do it from a DAO perspective. If, as a community, we decided that, I don't know, Board Apes get to trade for 0 or, I don't know, I don't think that it makes it centralized. If we make the decision like the Universe team, that can centralize.

**Ryan:** If the feature would be done through a DAO vote, the funds went to the DAO as payment for priority. It would be theoretically decentralized. However, I'm still not clear what will grow the Universe Marketplace. Because you'll be seeing listings that are not on the floor higher up, which may be confusing, misleading, and probably doesn't increase the healthy matches you want to see. 

## White Label Marketplace

**Ryan:** So, we're working on another big lead. Is talking to specific projects. I'm not going to name any names, of course, but the goal being to set up White Label Marketplaces because our fees are at 1.69% and in the future we may have a vote to lower them even further. We're already becoming an attractive option for those looking for White Label Solutions and anyone who wants to start a Marketplace. It makes their life a lot easier if all they have to do is look straight into the Universe protocol, post their listings to us, and retrieve them from us. It's all nice and comfy, and we take a much lower cut than OpenSea, Rariable and everyone else.

And there's also some interesting stuff there on security. Over the last year, I know a big issue with OpenSea has been this trickiness with multiple listings and listings getting bought that you thought were cancelled. So both the Universe Marketplace and all White Label Solutions would integrate at the moment and would have a token that can only be listed one time. If you want to relist, it has to be cancelled, so that eliminates that issue. Now, this can be changed to the DAO vote if were; well, I want to be able to lower without having to cancel. We can build that. That's possible. But right now, that's in there as a security feature, and it goes a long way in preventing a lot of that stuff we've seen on OpenSea.

**Community Member:** Yo, what's up, guys?

**Ryan:** How are you doing?

**Community Member:** Chilling. 

### **Question:**

I didn't know if you guys touched on the hardware wallets already, But I was just wondering if those were live yet or not.

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** We did touch on those, so those are planned for the first sprint, so I think that feature may be fixed on Testnet already. I have to double-check, but I don't want to give a hard date, but I think it's to be expected by the end of next week.

**Community Member:** Okay, awesome. Thanks. I appreciate it.

**Mark:** Thank you for your question, sir.

## Pre AMA Questions ?

### **Question:**

What do you think about Universe memberships that offer zero fees and other perks?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** That's a dope idea.

**Ryan:** I like the idea. Of course, I think the specifics are very tricky to get right on paper. But I think we already have Universe memberships somehow, right. Polymorphs exist. I'm not saying Polymorphs are getting zero fees. Do not misquote me like that. But the point is there are already Universe membership clubs, so maybe that might be something to build off if that's what the community is interested in. Other perks, I'm not sure right off the top of my head what those perks might look like. Again, I don't want to go back to priority listings because it sounds like a nice simple perk, but I don't think it would be effective. But I do like the idea in the general direction, and as we said, we are reevaluating the tokenomics and incentive models for release. So maybe a Universe membership could be a part of that.

**Mark:** I think maybe I misunderstood this premium listing thing. Is this asking if this is, How you can pay to promote your listing?

**Ryan:** Yeah, maybe it's a fancy background or not a background like a border around it or something like that. Like a little rainbow.

**Mark:** I'm sure you can do premium listings on this example of eBay, and they show up at the top and get more eyes on it. So you could pay extra to be shown at the top of this. I don't think that would work with the way that Marketplaces are. Because I use ebay, and I understand most people, when you're searching for sports cards on ebay, there's a bunch of different cards, and there's a bunch of different prices. But the app doesn't sort based on which card it exactly is. There are so many Leo Messi cards, and there are so many Michael Jordan cards, but some certain ones are worth so much. In NFT,s when you're looking, it's just a different collection search type. If you were to pay for a premium listing in the sense of ebay, your stuff would get filtered out because someone's just going to filter the stuff to go to the lowest price. Or they have the optimal search that they try to do on the Marketplace, and then you can't show listings on an optimal search because then it just looks like ads, then it's like this isn't decentralized, especially if people can pay for their centralized.

**Ryan:** It would be very gross.

**Mark:** I don't think this works.

**Ryan:** I don't know if you guys have seen the Mark Zuckerberg movie, and maybe not the best person to take this from, but when he was building Facebook, they were all trying to get ads in there, and he was like, no, it's not cool. We don't want to do anything. Not cool. I think that's a good strategy to follow.

**Mark:** I like that.

**Ryan:** I don't think we have that plan with the zero-fee OTC swaps. If that's a feature, that's something everyone wants to see. I think that's something that we can get prioritized. Again, if that is something you and the community want to see, throw that up onto a forum post, get a few responses on there, funnel that into a snapshot and start working.

**Mark:** Beautiful.

**Ryan:** Fluffer Nutter. I'm not ecstatic either about the attacks on the Metaverse, but a good movie.

**Mark:** Super good movie.

It makes you want it. I don't know. All right, let's see if anyone puts any more questions in the forum. It doesn't look like it.

**Ryan:** If anyone's posting questions, it will be in the Pre AMA at this point.

**Mark:** Give a few more minutes if anyone wants to wrap up any thoughts. Anything.

Yes. I think the main focus here is transparency and communication. Over the last week, we've been speaking internally on. We're not so big on paid marketing in NFTs and Crypto. There are very different marketing strategies. We're not going to be marketing the token. If we are marketing anything, it's going to be the Marketplace. But we are going to really be working on communicating everything to the community and just being as transparent as possible, moving forward with what's going on and what's being blocked. We're just going to keep listening to the community, and we think that everyone keeps saying we need to be communicating a little more. 

### **Question:**

Ryan Scol's asking; What's the current status of the scraper? What metrics are we targeting?

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** So I know we may have in our Medium article written that the scraper cannot get any faster. That was not true. We managed to make it faster; we didn't think we could at that time. It is getting faster, and we're making optimizations there. I have to work on some tooling to get better metrics on how far through the chain it is. I may have mentioned on community calls before that it's not one process that just goes backwards or forwards in time and scrapes the blockchain; it's like 20 interconnected services. So until the NFTs move through all of these services, it's not completed, and it can be at different States at different points in time. So it's quite tricky to give a very clear-cut answer on something like that. 

### **Question:**

When is this completion expected? 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** This is another tricky one to answer. Once we integrate these optimizations, I think we'll start to work on timing and how much longer we think it'll take to scrape the rest of the chain. I hope it's quick, but that's relative, and all scraping the chain, especially when scraping several years of it, takes time.

And there's also a lot of things like that IPFs links and other stuff out there that we have workarounds for, but it always just goes to throw bottlenecks in an already very tricky system. None of the data is normalized. Anyone can put whatever they want on the blockchain. So we're working on the scraper, and it's probably, one of the most important things that we need to have hammered out before moving from beta to a full release. 

**Mark:** And not to mention, sometimes we will run into crazy file types with the scraper and then have to bring extra support. So eventually, you will be able to spend your ASM brains and all those different cool spinnable NFTs and all those different files. We have to do that one by one, and we'll run into those issues and fix them.  

**Ryan:** Our scraper does scrape the 3D files already. And if you guys want to see those rotatable on the Marketplace, show some support for that feature, whether it's on a forum post, that's a good idea, and we will 100% implement it. We're a very close matter of what to prioritize, and there's a lot to do. If that's something you're very excited about, make sure to holler at us.

**Mark:** If we see people requesting stuff, we'll try to queue it up on the priority list Scol. 

### **Question:**

We've answered this question a lot; Will trading fees be distributed to stakers? That seems to be the strongest web3 hook the broader community rallies around.

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We can have a DAO vote about that, but the team and we're not pushing for that, and we're not going to do that ourselves. But if the community wants to do that.

**Ryan:** We can't stop the community from doing whatever they want. With that said, there are certain things that we cannot do and will not encourage. We are looking into tokinnomics, and just because that particular model is not feasible for the team to encourage and put forward. We are looking into other models that our Web3 asks for. And hit the hammer on the head there without getting into that regulatory trouble. 

**Mark:** Another thing I do want to be transparent about one of the first things that we are trying to nail down and fix is filtering, search optimization, and search engine optimization. But we've listed the community. We've taken screenshots of things that you all requested. We have to restructure it and re-architect the searching a little bit. It didn't work completely the way that it was supposed to, and we think we've queued up the problems and know what we need to fix and what we need to add. So filtering by traits and properties and all that stuff is coming. Being able to search a user, search a collection, search an NFT, and either shows up by, we need to figure out if it's going to search by most searches or by volume. I think that's something the community could give some input on; we're just redoing it. But I think it may take a few weeks to get all that sealed up. But that is one of our huge main priority focuses because we know how important it is to have a search that works.

### **Question:**

What is the estimated time for the scraper to get all done? It looks like it is a very slow process.

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Resistance, it's hard to guess when the scraper could be done. Scraping could be three months; it could be a year. We have absolutely no idea. I think it's a guessing question because it's working in real-time. It's trying to work backwards. But every time someone mints a new NFT, it starts working from the beginning again.

**Ryan:** It doesn't restart every time somebody mints thankful. That would be horrifying work so that you know because then all that progress would be undone. Every block moves through it. But hopefully, in the next few weeks, you're going to see it move a lot quicker.

**Mark:** And I think the more blocks it gets through, the faster it'll go.

**Ryan:** Yes, that's true because it's already discovered most of the collections once it gets through like 25% of the blocks, and it doesn't have to rescrape them.

**Mark:** Nice.

**Ryan:** Yeah.

### **Question:**

Okay. This next question by Axe where he's saying; Any thoughts around rewarding marketplace members with tier discounts? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think this kind of goes back to what we already discussed with the ID centralized question on the premium payments. Resistance brought up a membership, or Underground Man brought it up. It's an interesting concept. I think this would be a cool discussion in a forum post about turning some Universe entities into the ability to have a discount. But then who pays that discount? Would it be the Marketplace fees?

**Ryan:** I think that's the only place there's room for any flexibility. As for the DAO, it's the only one they can control.

**Mark:** Yeah, but if the Marketplace fee right now is 1%, what do you do? 

**Ryan:** We can upgrade the royalties contract to, for example, have an NFT that doesn't pay fees and could have a membership NFT that doesn't like. These are all possible. It's just a matter of which one makes the most sense in his way.

**Mark:** I was looking, and he's saying 10% cheaper.

**Ryan:** I responded to that specific question. It seemed like a cool idea, but it would probably be very gas-efficient to keep track of how many purchases the user has. Then also giving them a different fee rate. Maybe if we do this NFT model, we can keep track somehow of how many you've minted and then how many trades you've made and then let you mint this NFT if you're like a power user or something. That may expire in a year, like in the NFT just-auto self-destructs? Not exactly, but it stops working. So there are different ways we could do this thing. Exactly. It's a matter of how sustainable they are.

**Mark:** Okay, I see what Axe is saying. He's saying like 10% of the 1%. Do you see what I'm saying? I'm trying to think of where if it's 10% of the 1% fee, then it's 0.1%. What kind of discount is that on the other Marketplace?

**Ryan:** On trading platforms, that's something they like to offer, but I don't know if that is enticing on an on-chain platform.

**Mark:** It's a really good question. It's a really good thought. I think, to be honest, Axe. I think that this is a pretty good question, but I do think that we should revisit this in a little bit when the Marketplace has a lot more listings and volume. To see if this is a possibility. And if it's something that the community wants, then, yeah. Also, for anyone who wants to know, Tyler wasn't on this call because he had to do some stuff. So sorry for everyone who joined to hear Tyler talk, but that's why he's not chiming in behind me.

**John:** Hey, Mark, can I ask a question?

**Mark:** Yeah, for sure.

**John:** Hey, guys, it's John. I poke my head in every once to see what's going on. But this is just a question from being outside looking in. I know you guys are all, you know, all the nuances and details of all the work that you guys have put in first. Congratulations on launching.

**Mark:** Thank you. We appreciate you locking me out of my own house.

**John:** The other piece is knowing you guys and how hard you guys have been working on this; it would be helpful to know as sort of an outsider. 

### **Question:**

What are the bulleted points? What are the key differentiators that make Universe better than any other choice? So that it's not for me. I think just for the Market. It would be easy to help them see even beyond the lower percentage fee, just like other intangibles and other big features or functionalities are way better to entice people to make the switch and start even searching in more than one place. That's just a high-level sort of, just outside the details.

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I can answer it quickly, and I'll try to leave the features out just because I don't want anyone to know what some of the cool minting contracts we have are coming out. But if you want to know from a Marketplace how we're different. We're a decentralized protocol that a DAO runs. The DAO in this Marketplace can't be taken down; it's going to work even if Tyler, Ryan, and I are all at this point. Still, this thing can run without us, and that's the true power of a decentralized protocol or entity. This Marketplace is run by a governance token that gives so much opportunity and power into the community's hands. What we built is an OpenSea that the community can run, and we are going to give full control to the community. Suppose the community comes in and votes, something like the DAO. It will do it because that's how governance needs to work. We will open up a lot of Universe and move our work into Discord and start doing things with bounty programs where people can build certain API connections and truly make Universe an open-source building block connector in the whole ecosystem.

What is the interesting thing about having a protocol in us? Going and building tools. For the Metaverse and other metaverse companies like FLUF World, Crypto Voxels, Decentraland, and Somnium. I had the ability to buy something off the wall because there's a front-end UI that connects to an Immutable protocol that no one can shut off. There are listings anyone can access from any front end as long as they have the proper back end connection. But that's the power of having this open-source thing that anyone could connect to and build. I think that is not a bulleted list, but that is how this is different from anything else. Zora has positioned itself in a way that we have as being a protocol that many people can plug into. Zora is in the DAO that's run by a governance token. So I think there's much power in that. I think that's the main difference. I know what we've been working on, the new features, and the entire NFT space hasn't seen anything like this.

We're taking a more of the manifold approach of coming, creating cool custom contracts that are unique and people will use. The people writing these contracts are like the free-thinking philosophers of the NFT space. Tim Kang is one of the smartest people that I've ever met when talking about NFTs, and everything that he's ever told me was going to happen. He's writing these contracts; they're for stuff that no one's doing right now. But as soon as people see these NFT contracts, they will be Holy s--t; I didn't even know that we can make NFT like this. Then people will have a whole new medium of how they're going to be able to mint their work, and we're going to have all these new types of NFTs that Universe is going to bring. People are going to be, what the hell? I'm not going to give any alpha on those. But we have 3 or 4 unique minting contracts coming to the space. Within the next two months, we'll be on the Universe Marketplace as long as we have the bandwidth to bring it all, assuming that we get all these Marketplace bugs fixed quickly and fix the search.

I think that's the main thing we need to do. I don't want to be up here and just say, we're building the biggest, baddest Marketplace ever. Our Marketplace is going to have its own features. Chuba can talk more about some of the Marketplace features coming. When we sought to build this, it was to be built for artists. That is still going to be our focus creating new tools for Artists to mint work and create a new medium for them to show their work and art. I'm excited about some of the stuff we built because I want to see what people do with it. There's one contract that we wrote, and I want to see what Zach Transmental is going to do. He probably has no idea what I'm even talking about, but I'm super excited. But I'll hop back into some more questions because we've given some people highlighting the benefit and differences. Hey, Resistance, we are working on a video for that.

**Ryan:** Jump in with that question. Where was it? The one you were just answering Resistance tagging me? 

### **Question:**

Right before that, Can you talk about any particular integrations you'll have in FLUF and ASM? Landworks connected to burrows.

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I can talk about some of this stuff. We are going to talk to Aaron. I'm going to have a conversation with them. I have some stuff that I want to integrate. I'm an advisor for Altered State Machines. I don't know if people know that, but I'm 1 of 6 or 7 advisors. I have a call with Hal from ASM tomorrow, and we have a lot to talk about. I also am going to get on a call with Aaron and Tyler. We have some things we want to talk about.

**Ryan:** I know FLUFs and ASM have buttons on their site that say OpenSea. That's going to be one of the topics of our conversations. We will probably not ask them to change those buttons right away. Until we get that search function, I don't want to be asking Aaron and everyone to be, pushing the Marketplace that doesn't have a function like a search that will make people want to use it. So our thinking right now is that within 2 to 3 weeks, if we can get this fixed, I'm going to get Aaron, and we're already aligned with them. Everyone on the FLUF and ASM teams all talks together. I've been working with David and Aaron for three years. Tyler has been working with them for 4 to 5 years. We're all very aligned, and we're all going to work together. I can tell you guys some integrations that I have contributors in Universe.

**Algy:** Aaron is much Universe, too, so it's mutual. We try to help them, and they try to help us. Even the FLUFs exist. You go on our website and scroll down and see that we're partnered with them. We helped create those.

**Mark:** Aaron is an advisor for Universe, so everyone's all very involved, but I can give some just examples of things like even entertaining, which I think has a great opportunity on our Marketplace. When you have a Decentraland or a Crypto Voxels asset or a FLUF Burrow that you want to rent out, you should be able to rent that out through Universe; through the front end of Universe, it's get rented out through the Land Works back end. I'm not sure if everyone knows this, but Lime Chain, who runs Enter DAO. We have many developers who work at Universe from Lime Chain, and they are all very involved. This goes back to our alignment with some of these big projects. Tyler is a founder of Enter DAO, and Tyler is a founder of FLUF World and Non-Fungible Labs. Tyler is also an advisor for ASM. I want to go to the Marketplace, see my brain, click on it, and maybe drop it in my FLUF from the Marketplace. I mean, building a Marketplace that has interoperability with the metaverse and gaming assets will win, but we have to have teams that want to come and integrate with us.

So we're going to start with FLUF World, and we'll have a button that lets you jump into your burrow from the Universe website. But it's going to take time for us to make those integrations. Our main focus is building a Marketplace that works before we add all that cool s--t. Just know that that stuff is coming, and we're not going to push that on the FLUFs. It's fair to say that I'm saying that about a product that we built. I'm just trying to be as honest as possible because transparency is massively important in the DAO. I have to do something quickly, but I'll be back. 

**Algy:** Where do we leave off? 

**Mark:** We got through them all. Atari De Dmici was the last question right above where Resistance tagged me. 

**Ryan:** I think to highlight one of the points Mark was making earlier about some of the key differences or benefits of the Universe Marketplace. And he mentioned multiple times that we're a DAO, a community. I want to stress how important the DAO-controlled Marketplace is because it's cool, and you can govern the system. What does that mean? For example, it means that things like, say the year is 2030, and you write articles about NFTs and link to Universe, and you get like a 2% cop for doing that every time a sale happens, right? And suddenly, Universe is we want to make more money or, Universe can do this. But say competing centralized platform goes, we don't need to be paying these guys anymore. We can stop paying the fees. At Universe, something like that can't happen without a DAO vote. All the people involved will have had plenty of time to participate and get involved and stop something like that from happening. That goes from examples that Tyler much better described on a previous call. To everything from content that's getting pulled off our platform, aside from illegal content and egregious stuff that needs to be pulled or DMCA requests.

We have to abide with those. For content to be removed from the platform. We will need a DAO vote to align the community on what is being removed. And why and what the transgression was and whether they can modify it to comply. Looks Rare isn't decentralized. I know it's a wash website, so Looks Rare is not a DAO. As far as I know, they do have a token and smart contract, so I don't know if they ever plan to be a DAO, but I know right now that you don't have one up and running.

**Algy:** There's a question that says, What's the current status of the scraper with like bullet points? Do you see that question?

**Ryan:** Yeah, we went over that.

**Algy:** I don't think I see any other questions that we didn't discuss either. Oh, I looked at the wrong tag. 

### **Question:**

Do we want to leak any alpha on Graviton? 

#### **Answer:**

**Algy:** I think only Troy can talk about that. The fact that he knows the alpha, I don't know the alpha. I don't know if Troy is on this call right now. I see his name. If he wants to talk about it, he might be busy. But if he can hear us and wants to talk about it, he's welcome. 

### **Question:**

What's new with Goblin Town? 

#### **Answer:**

**Algy:** You will have to ask the FLUF World peeps about that because remember, we explained Tyler came up with that idea.

The FLUF team took it over. So if you want info on Goblin Town, you will have to press the FLUF team, the Seeker team. It does look like they've been leaking some information on it. The Seekers were part of the lore for the Goblins. I would guess that there will be another drop similar to the Seekers, which will be the Goblins. I bet it'll be a similar style, like the same type of draw-up.

Looks Rare isn't decentralized. I just read that out loud because I want everyone on this call to understand our viewpoint at Universe. Looks Rare, and OpenSea isn't our competition or our enemy. We hope that people realize that Ethereum is the superior blockchain for NFTs. In general, you already see these issues with these bridges that are getting hacked. That L2s are already becoming a problem. In the future, Vitalik always says, he will eventually get the gas feed lowered, and ETH will be the thing everyone uses.

Our competition is just another blockchain trying to take the Market from Ethereum and mainly anything that competes with NFTs on Ethereum in general. OpenSea and Looks Rare doing well is inevitable. The Universe does well, so there's no way that we're ever going to be against OpenSea. As a person at Universe, we have more opportunities to succeed if they succeed. Our product is better than both of those products. So I'm not worried about taking away there; I'm not worried about anything. So I don't think Universe is ever going to jump in. I see many people always trying to get us to say something bad about OpenSea. It's never going to happen because of the fact that we like OpenSea, and they might not be the best Marketplace in the future, but they have the foundation for what we want to build and do better.

I don't feel like I see any more questions. Do you have anything else that you want to add?

**Ryan:** No. We covered all of the questions we covered what we're going to be focusing on and working towards in the near future and a little bit in the long term. I know I'm incredibly excited about what's coming, and I hope everyone else is. So I know I will see you guys in 2 weeks on this call.

**John:** If you're listening on YouTube, guys like and subscribe, share with your friends and make sure you're posting listings on Universe and telling your friends to do the same. That's what helps us. It's just community marketing instead of the paid stuff that some people want.

**Algy:** Just listing your NFTs on Universe is smart, too, because you are saving money if it gets swept on Gem as a seller. If you're trying to off NFTs and there is a 90% chance you're listening on the floor, it will get bought on Gem, not on OpenSea or Looks Rare. So listing on OpenSea or Looks Rare is ineffective if you're trying to make as much money possible off your entities because they're going to get bought in the same place regardless, and you could be saving that fee. 

That guy Max Stealth, he sweeps, right? Every time he sweeps, he uses Gem. So if you guys were listing your plus like the people selling their plus, we're listing them on Universe. When somebody like Max Stealth sweeps the floor, you would be making more money having that listed on Universe instead. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I'm just stating that you're effectively losing money listing on other websites because people are buying on Gem regardless. You guys all know this. That's why you're in the AMA. 

**Ryan:** Thanks, everyone.

**Rayne:** Cheers. Everyone. Bye.
