## Intro

**Ryan:** All right. Well, I'll jump in.

First and foremost, I just want to thank everyone on the Universe team for all the incredible work this last year and especially this last month. üååüíô

For the last two months, everyone is doing everything they possibly can to launch the Marketplace. That's been incredible. The craziness internationally and everything else going on. We put up a forum for AMA questions, thanks to [Transmental](https://twitter.com/transmental), that's where we'll aggregate AMA questions. We do have the channel opened in here. So, if you do want to post questions in there, that's okay. Going forward, we'd appreciate people aggregating the questions into the forum as much as possible so that there can be some discussion on these things with the community before we go and comment on them on the community calls.

**Ryan:** Let me give a few updates on what's coming first.

## Updates [[01:23]](https://youtu.be/0BwFX1lkCuY?t=83) ‚è´

**Ryan:** We have two planned releases that we are working on. 

- The 1st is version 1.01, and then version 1.1. So the 1st version you guys are going to see will have a bunch of hotfixes, bug fixes things like the ledger issue.

- In the new version 1.1, hopefully coming very soon. You're going to see the ability to share Universe links across social media platforms, Discord, and send links to other people. Along with other optimizations in that domain. 

We're looking to get some of the other major improvements ASAP; there will be 1 to 2 sprints before these are out or things like 1155 support. There's a lot of stuff in the works, the order migration, bulk listings. It's going to have to come with each feature release. We will keep you guys posted on that. We'll try to aggregate some information on some specific features that are actively being worked on, so you guys can then take a look at them. We can probably jump into questions now. 

**Mark:** We have been listening to the community about communication. You guys want a little more transparency about, What's going on? What we're currently working on? What features are coming? 

So we will be pushing for better open communications; I think we will either start posting a weekly or a bi-weekly medium. Regarding the progress we've made: the current week or time frame. Then what is to be expected from the following sprint. That's not always to say that we are going to get those things done. If we post it, say we're working on this other thing next week, it doesn't always mean we're going to knock it out in a week. But we are going to try to be a lot more transparent and communicate because it seems that's what the community is asking the most from us and the team. We hear you guys, and we're going to work on that.

## Forum Questions [[04:00]](https://youtu.be/0BwFX1lkCuY?t=240) üìí

### **Question: JD Buffalo** ‚ùì

What has the team has learned from some of the back and forth? 

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** Well, on the communication question and a lot of the issues there, I think that goes partly to what Mark addresses there. I'm not going to read the second part of this comment. It's very concerned with the Token price. I believe that the focus and emphasis on the energy should be spent on building a healthy Universe protocol. What that means to me is working towards increasing listings on the platform. Increasing matches and sales on the forum, increasing the number of users who go to the website every day its metrics. When all of these things grow, you can come to your conclusions. The most important thing to the Universe ecosystem is the growth and health of the product. I think everything else is, I don't want to say tertiary, but it's not what needs to be the priority because it's existential that the Marketplace is used and accurate fees and continues to grow.

Without growth, there is nothing. Even if the token price is up or down, it's meaningless without a booming ecosystem in the Universe protocol. Okay, enough about token price. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Can we work with Gem to make the Universe brand more prominent in the listings? 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** OpenSea and Looks pop better than the Universe symbol. Transmental has sourced the icon for the one that will stand out and be prominent. We're going to send that over to the Gem guys today and then to Genie when we get integrated with them. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Thoughts on two product updates/changes, what do you guys think?

1. Contract Checked Checkbox before Checkout (cwutididthar)

2. Premium Priority Payments for Projects (weakaf)

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** The core idea was when a user goes to buy a contract or buy a token. We give them some links on verifying that they are buying the actual contract and maybe click a check box or sign a message saying that they have verified it. 

A. To educate the community and 
B. Potentially some legal coverage, though. I don't know whether that is material or not. I'm not a lawyer.

Then another idea he discusses is, 
2. Premium priority payments for projects? 

**Ryan:** This idea would be something like prioritized listings. That may be if you take XYZ, you get a priority listing, or if you pay extra to the DAO, you get a priority listing. I'm not sure how I feel about that one, but it's a DAO. Post your responses in the form, and we'll see if that's an idea that latches on. There's too much supply.

We can also create backlinks to videos on how to check contracts. I don't know if there are any really good resources, but I know we can put some in the other.

**Mark:** We need to learn better security in the space, check the contracts, and learn to verify contract addresses. Our team, especially Rayne, has even said he's going to try to make a video so that you can teach people how to verify that contract address. It has a place in the docs, and we can add those things. I don't think it's good UX or great UI to have a video in a checkout. Maybe create a short little course that you have to go through the Universe course when you first connect your wallet. I don't know. I think there are ways that we could do that, but I don't want to distract us from the Marketplace to make something like that. We definitely can make videos. (I'm saying it would be annoying if a video popped up on a checkout screen)

**Ryan:** I think we can style it elegantly because the questions are about tokenomics; I want to address that. We are internally reviewing the tokenomics and potential incentives for the full Marketplace Launch. I can't give details or specifics on what that may or may not look like. It's an ongoing legal process that involves making sure that everything is entirely above board. We do understand that it is something that is frequently discussed. The tokenomics questions, and we'll hope to be able to provide more clear-cut answers as we get them. There is a big focus on that. Ensure all the incentives are aligned and that the incentives that may exist in the future work towards increasing the health of the Universe Marketplace. The growth of the Marketplace, the liquidity, the number of matches on it, the number of users, and all the other metrics we may care about.

### Shoutout: [Smalltime](https://twitter.com/smalltime_anon)

**Rayne:** Shout out to Smalltime. He made a video for us about how to check contracts, so I'll link to that in the Pre AMA channel, and I'll put it on the forum too.

> [Link to Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfN15HvtDg)

**Ryan:** Appreciate it, ser. 

We don't have any more forum questions, but the Pre AMA is open, you guys can post anything that you may want to ask. I don't know if any of the other speakers on the panel have any thoughts on this premium priority payment stuff. I don't know if that has much support. The author seems ecstatic about it, so I'm not sure we need to give it too much daylight, but I'm just trying to hone in on some community discussions.

**Mark:** My comment is that we probably shouldn't do it‚Äî as a team. I think this needs to get discussed as a community.

**Ryan:** If the feature would be done through a DAO vote, the funds went to the DAO as payment for priority. It would be theoretically decentralized. However, I'm still not clear what will grow the Universe Marketplace.

## White Label Marketplace [[12:12(https://youtu.be/0BwFX1lkCuY?t=732) üè™

**Ryan:** We're working on another big lead. Talking to specific projects. I'm not going to name any names, of course, but the goal being to set up white label marketplaces because our fees are at 1.69% and in the future we may have a vote to lower them even further. 

We're already becoming an attractive option for those looking for white label solutions and anyone who wants to start a marketplace. It makes their life a lot easier if all they have to do is look straight into the Universe protocol, post their listings to us, and retrieve them from us. It's all nice and comfy, and we take a lower cut than OpenSea, Rarible and everyone else.

Over the last year, I know a big issue with OpenSea has been this trickiness with multiple listings and listings getting bought that you thought were cancelled. Both the Universe Marketplace and all white label solutions would have a token that can only be listed one time. If you want to relist, it has to be cancelled, so that eliminates the issue. Now, this can be changed with a DAO vote; I want to lower my price without having to cancel. We can build that. That's possible. 

Right now, that's there as a security feature, and it goes a long way in preventing a lot of that stuff we've seen on OpenSea.


### **Question:** ‚ùì

Are hardware wallets live yet?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** We did touch on those, so those are planned for the first sprint, that feature may be fixed on testnet already. I have to double-check, I don't want to give a hard date. I think it's to be expected by the end of next week.

**Community Member:** Okay, awesome. Thanks. I appreciate it.

**Mark:** Thank you for your question, sir.

## Pre AMA Questions [[14:35]](https://youtu.be/0BwFX1lkCuY?t=875) ‚ÅâÔ∏è

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What do you think about Universe memberships that offer zero fees and other perks?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** That's a dope idea.

**Ryan:** I like the idea. Of course, I think the specifics are very tricky to get right on paper. I think we already have Universe memberships in a way. Polymorphs exist. 

I'm not saying Polymorphs are getting zero fees. Do not misquote me like that. 

The point is there are already Universe membership clubs, so maybe that might be something to build off‚Äî if that's what the community is interested in. Other perks, I'm not sure right off the top of my head. Again, I don't want to go back to priority listings. It sounds like a nice simple perk, but I don't think it would be effective. I do like the idea and the general direction. We are reevaluating the tokenomics and incentive models for release. Maybe a Universe membership could be a part of that.

**Mark:** I think maybe I misunderstood this premium listing thing. Is this asking if this is, How you can pay to promote your listing?

**Ryan:** Yeah, maybe it's a fancy background or not a background like a border around it or something like that. Like a little rainbow.

**Mark:** I'm sure you can do premium listings on this example of eBay, and they show up at the top and get more eyes on it. 

You could pay extra to be shown at the top of this. I don't think that would work with the way that Marketplaces are. Because I use ebay, and I understand most people, when you're searching for sports cards on ebay, there's a bunch of different cards, and there's a bunch of different prices. But the app doesn't sort based on which card it exactly is. There are so many Leo Messi cards, and there are so many Michael Jordan cards, certain ones are worth money. With NFTs when you're looking, it's a different type of search. If you were to pay for a premium listing in the sense of ebay, your stuff would get filtered out because someone's going to filter everything to the lowest price. Or they have the optimal search that they try to do on the Marketplace, and then you can't show listings on an optimal search because then it just looks like ads‚Äî it starts the trend towards centralization.

**Ryan:** It would be very gross. 

**Mark:** I don't think this works.

**Ryan:** I don't know if you guys have seen the Mark Zuckerberg movie, and maybe not the best person to take this from, but when he was building Facebook, they were all trying to get ads in there, and he was like, no, it's not cool. We don't want to do anything. Not cool. I think that's a good strategy to follow.

**Mark:** I like that.

**Ryan:** I don't think we have that plan with the zero-fee OTC swaps. If that's a feature, that's something everyone wants to see. I think that's something that we can get prioritized. Again, if that is something you and the community want to see, throw that up onto a forum post, get a few responses on there, funnel that into a snapshot and start working.

**Mark:** Beautiful.

**Ryan:** Fluffer Nutter. I'm not ecstatic either about the attacks on the Metaverse, but a good movie.

**Mark:** Super good movie.

It makes you want it. I don't know. All right, let's see if anyone puts any more questions in the forum. It doesn't look like it.

**Ryan:** If anyone's posting questions, it will be in the Pre AMA at this point.

**Mark:** Give a few more minutes if anyone wants to wrap up any thoughts. Anything.

Yes. I think the main focus here is transparency and communication. Over the last week, we've been speaking internally about this. We're not so big on paid marketing in NFTs and Crypto. There are very different marketing strategies. We're not going to be marketing the token. If we are marketing anything, it's going to be the Marketplace. We are going to be working on communicating everything to the community. Increasing transparency moving forward surrounding what's going on and what's being blocked. We're are listening to you all!

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What's the current status of the scraper? What metrics are we targeting?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** I know we may have in our Medium article written that the scraper cannot get any faster. That was not true. 

We managed to make it faster; we didn't think we could at that time. It is getting faster, and we're making optimizations there. I have to work on some tooling to get better metrics on how far through the chain it is. I may have mentioned on community calls before that it's not one process‚Äî it scrapes backwards & forwards in time ‚Äîit's like 20 interconnected services. Until the NFTs move through all of these services, it's not completed, and it can be at different states at different points in time. It's quite tricky to give a very clear-cut answer on something like that. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

When is this completion expected? 

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** This is another tricky one to answer. Once we integrate these optimizations, I think we'll start to work on timing and how much longer we think it'll take to scrape the rest of the chain. I hope it's quick, but that's relative‚Äî we are scraping several years of data.

There's also a lot of things like that IPFs links and other stuff out there that we have to create workarounds for, it throws bottlenecks in a complex, tricky system. None of the data is normalized. Anyone can put whatever they want on the blockchain. This is probably, one of the most critical things that we need to get hammered out before moving from beta to a full release. 

**Mark:** Also, we will run into crazy file types with the scraper and then have to bring extra support. Eventually, you will be able to interact with your ASM brains and all those cool spinnable NFTs.(Interactive file types) We have to do that one by one, we'll run into issues then fix them.  

**Ryan:** Our scraper does scrape the 3D files already. And if you guys want to see those rotatable on the Marketplace, show some support for that feature, whether it's on a forum post, that's a good idea, and we will 100% implement it. We're a very close matter of what to prioritize, and there's a lot to do. If that's something you're very excited about, make sure to holler at us.

**Mark:** If we see people requesting stuff, we'll try to queue it up on the priority list. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

 Will trading fees be distributed to stakers? That seems to be the strongest web3 hook the broader community rallies around.

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We can have a DAO vote about that, but as a team we're not pushing for that.

**Ryan:** We can't stop the community from doing whatever they want. 

With that said, there are certain things that we cannot do and will not encourage. We are looking into tokenomics. That particular model is not feasible for the team to encourage and put forward. We are looking into other models that steer clear of regulatory trouble. 

**Mark:** One of the first things that we are trying to nail down and fix is filtering, search optimization, and search engine optimization. We've taken screenshots of things that you have requested. We have to restructure it and re-architect the searching a little bit. It didn't work completely the way that it was supposed to. We believe we've queued up the problems and know what we need to fix and what we need to add. Filtering by traits and properties and all that stuff is coming. Being able to search a user, search a collection, search an NFT. That's something the community can give some input on; we're  redoing it. I think it may take a few weeks to get all that sealed up. But that is one of our priorities. We know how important it is to have a search function that works.

### **Question: Resistance** ‚ùì

What is the estimated time for the scraper to get all done? It looks like it is a very slow process.

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** It's hard to guess when the scraper could be done. Scraping could be three months; it could be a year. We have absolutely no idea. I think it's a guessing question because it's working in real-time. But every time someone mints a new NFT, it starts working from the beginning again.

**Ryan:** It doesn't restart every time somebody mints thankfulyl. That would be horrifying. All that progress would be undone. Every block moves through it and gets indexed. Hopefully, in the next few weeks, you're going to see it move a lot quicker.

**Mark:** I think the more blocks it gets through, the faster it'll go.

**Ryan:** Yes, that's true because it's already discovered most of the collections once it gets through like 25% of the blocks, and it doesn't have to rescrape them.

**Mark:** Nice.

**Ryan:** Yeah.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Any thoughts around rewarding marketplace members with tier discounts? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think this kind of goes back to what we already discussed with the ID centralized question on the premium payments. It's an interesting concept. This would be a cool discussion in a forum post‚Äî giving some Universe entities a discount. 

However, who pays that discount? Would it be the Marketplace fees?

**Ryan:** I think that's the only place there's room for any flexibility. It's controlled by the DAO.

**Mark:** Yeah, but if the Marketplace fee right now is 1%, what do you do? 

**Ryan:** We can upgrade the royalties contract to, for example, have an NFT that doesn't pay fees and could have a membership NFT that doesn't like. These are all possible. It's just a matter of which one makes the most sense in his way.

**Mark:** I was looking, and he's saying 10% cheaper.

**Ryan:** I responded to that specific question. It seemed like a cool idea, but it would probably be very gas-heavy to keep track of how many purchases the user has. Then also giving them a different fee rate. Maybe if we do this NFT model, we can keep track somehow of how many you've minted and then how many trades you've made and then let you mint this NFT if you're like a power user or something. That may expire in a year‚Äî kind of, it stops working. So there are different ways we could do this thing. Exactly. It's a matter of how sustainable they are.

On trading platforms, these discount schemes are something they like to offer, but I don't know if that is enticing for an on-chain platform.

**Mark:** It's a good question. It's a good thought. I think, to be honest, Axe. I think that this is a good question, we should revisit this in a little bit when the Marketplace has a lot more listings and volume. To see if this is a possibility.


**John:** Hey, guys, it's John. I poke my head in every once to see what's going on. This is a question from being outside looking in. I know you guys are all, you know, all the nuances and details of all the work that you guys have put in first. Congratulations on launching.

**Mark:** Thank you. We appreciate you locking me out of my own house.

**John:** The other piece is knowing you guys and how hard you guys have been working on this; it would be helpful to know as sort of an outsider. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What are the bulleted points? 

What are the key differentiators that make Universe better than any other choice? 

It's not for me‚Äî I think for the Market in general. It would be easy to help them see even beyond the lower percentage fee, like other intangibles and other big features or functionalities. They are way better to entice people to make the switch and start even searching in more than one place. That's just a high-level‚Äî kind of between the lines.

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I can answer it quickly, and I'll try to leave the features out.

How we're different as a marketplace; 

- We're a decentralized protocol that a DAO runs.
- The DAO can't be taken down; it's going to work even if Tyler, Ryan, and I are all dead. 
  - This thing can run without us, and that's the true power of a decentralized protocol or entity. 
- The Marketplace is controlled by a governance token; giving power and opportunity to the community. 
- We built an OpenSea that the community can run‚Äî we are going to give full control to the community. 
  - When the community votes something through the DAO. It will happen because that's how governance needs to work. 

We will open up a lot of Universe and move our work into Discord and start doing things with bounty programs where people can build certain API connections and truly make Universe an open-source building block connector in the whole ecosystem.

The interesting thing about building tools for the Metaverse and other metaverse companies like [FLUF World](https://www.fluf.world/), [Crypto Voxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), and [Somnium](https://somniumspace.com/). I had the ability to buy something off the wall because there's a front-end UI that connects to an immutable protocol that no one can shut off. There are listings anyone can access from any front end as long as they have the proper back end connection. But that's the power of having this open-source system that anyone could connect to and build on. I think that is not a bulleted list, but that is how this is different from anything else. Zora has positioned itself in a way that we have as being a protocol that many people can plug into. Zora is not a DAO that's run by a governance token. I think there's much power in that. I think that's the main difference. I know what we've been working on, the new features, and the entire NFT space hasn't seen anything like this.

We're taking a more of the [Manifold](https://www.manifold.xyz/) approach of coming, creating cool custom contracts that are unique and people will use. The people writing these contracts are like the free-thinking philosophers of the NFT space. Tim Kang is one of the smartest people that I've ever met when talking about NFTs, and everything that he's ever told me was going to happen. He's writing these contracts; they're for stuff that no one's doing right now. But as soon as people see these NFT contracts, they will be shocked. Then people will have a whole new medium and way to express themselves. I'm not going to give any alpha on those. We have 3 or 4 unique minting contracts coming. Within the next two months, they'll be on the Universe Marketplace‚Äî as long as we have the bandwidth. (Assuming that we get marketplace bugs fixed and the search function)

Our Marketplace is going to have its own features. Chuba can talk more about some of the marketplace features coming. When we sought to build this, it was to be built for artists. That is still going to be our focus creating new tools for artists to mint work and create a new medium for expression. 

I'm excited about some of the stuff we built because I want to see what people do with it. There's one contract that we wrote, and I want to see what Zach/Transmental will do. He probably has no idea what I'm even talking about, I'm super excited. I'll hop back into some more questions because we've given some people highlighting the benefit and differences. 


### **Question:** ‚ùì

Can you talk about any particular integrations you'll have in FLUF and ASM? Landworks connected to burrows?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I'm an advisor for Altered State Machines. I don't know if people know that, but I'm 1 of 6 or 7 advisors. I have a call with Hal from ASM tomorrow, and we have a lot to talk about. I also am going to get on a call with Aaron and Tyler. We have some things we want to talk about.

**Ryan:** I know FLUFs and ASM have buttons on their site that say OpenSea. That's going to be one of the topics of our conversations. 

We will probably not ask them to change those buttons right away. Until we get that search function, I don't want to be asking Aaron and everyone to be, pushing the marketplace that doesn't have a completed marketplace that will make people want to use it. Our thinking right now is that within 2 to 3 weeks, if we can get this fixed we'll push for integrations. I've been working with [David](https://twitter.com/dmcd_nz) and [Aaron](https://twitter.com/aaronmcdnz) for three years. Tyler has been working with them for 4 to 5 years. We're all very aligned, and we're all going to work together.

**Algy:** Aaron is much aligned with Universe, it's mutual. We try to help them, and they try to help us. Even the FLUFs exist. You go on our website and scroll down and see that we're partnered with them. We helped create those.

**Mark:** Aaron is an advisor for Universe, so everyone's all very involved. When you have a Decentraland or a CryptoVoxels asset or a FLUF Burrow that you want to rent out, you should be able to rent that out through Universe; through the front end of Universe, it's get rented out through the Land Works back end. I'm not sure if everyone knows this, but [Lime Chain](https://limechain.tech/index-2/), who runs [EnterDAO](https://enterdao.xyz/). We have many developers who work at Universe from Lime Chain, and they are all very involved. This goes back to our alignment with some of these big projects. Tyler is a founder of EnterDAO, and Tyler is a founder of FLUF World and [Non-Fungible Labs](https://www.nonfungiblelabs.xyz/). Tyler is also an advisor for [ASM](https://www.alteredstatemachine.xyz/). 

I want to go to the marketplace, see my brain, click on it, and maybe drop it in my FLUF from the marketplace. I mean, building a marketplace that has interoperability with the metaverse and gaming assets will win, but we have to have teams that want to come and integrate with us.

So we're going to start with FLUF World, and we'll have a button that lets you jump into your burrow from the Universe website. But it's going to take time for us to make those integrations. Our main focus is building a Marketplace that works before we add all that cool üí©. Just know that that stuff is coming, and we're not going to push that on the FLUFs. It's fair to say that I'm saying that about a product that we built. I'm just trying to be as honest as possible because transparency is massively important in the DAO.

**Ryan:** I think to highlight one of the points Mark was making earlier about some of the key differences or benefits of the Universe Marketplace. And he mentioned multiple times that we're a DAO, a community. 

I want to stress how important the DAO-controlled Marketplace is because it's cool, and you can govern the system. 

What does that mean? For example, it means things like; say the year is 2030, and you write articles about NFTs and link to Universe, and you get like a 2% cop for doing that every time a sale happens. Suddenly, Universe is we want to make more money or, Universe can do this. Say a competing centralized platform goes, we don't need to be paying these guys anymore‚Äî they can stop paying the fees. 

At Universe, something like that can't happen without a DAO vote. All the people involved will have had plenty of time to participate and get involved and stop something like that from happening. That goes from examples that Tyler much better described on a previous call. To everything from content that's getting pulled off our platform, aside from illegal content and egregious stuff that needs to be pulled or DMCA requests. üîë

We have to abide with international laws. When content is removed from the platform. We will need a DAO vote to align the community on what is being removed. And why and what the transgression was and whether they can modify it to comply. LooksRare isn't decentralized. I know LooksRare is not a DAO. As far as I know, they do have a token and smart contract, I don't know if they ever plan to be a DAO, but I know right now that you don't have one up and running.

**Algy:** I don't think I see any other questions that we didn't discuss either.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Do we want to leak any alpha on Graviton? 

### **Answer:**

**Algy:** I think only Troy can talk about that. He knows the alpha, I don't know the alpha. I don't know if Troy is on this call right now. I see his name. If he wants to talk about it, he might be busy. But if he can hear us and wants to talk about it, he's welcome. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What's new with Goblin Town? 

### **Answer:**

**Algy:** You will have to ask the FLUF World peeps about that because remember, we explained Tyler came up with that idea and gifted it because it was to similar to what the FLUF team was already planning.

The FLUF team took it over. If you want info on [Goblin Town](https://twitter.com/WeAreGoblinTown), you will have to press the FLUF team or the [Seeker](https://seekers.xyz/tw) team. It does look like they've been leaking some information on it. The Seekers were part of the lore for the Goblins. I would guess that there will be another drop similar to the Seekers, which will be the Goblins. I bet it'll be a similar style.

I want everyone on this call to understand our viewpoint at Universe. LooksRare, and OpenSea isn't our competition or our enemy. We hope that people realize that Ethereum is the superior blockchain for NFTs. In general, you already see these issues with these bridges that are getting hacked. That L2s are already becoming a problem. In the future, Vitalik always says, eventually the network fees will be much lower, and ETH will be the thing everyone uses.

Our competition is another blockchain trying to take the market-share from Ethereum and mainly anything that competes with NFTs on Ethereum in general. 

OpenSea and LooksRare doing well is inevitable. If Universe wants to do well, there's no way that we're ever going to be against OpenSea. As a person at Universe, we have more opportunities to succeed if they succeed. Our product is better than both of those products. I'm not worried about that. I don't think Universe is ever going to jump in. I see many people always trying to get us to say something bad about OpenSea. It's never going to happen because of the fact that we like OpenSea, and they might not be the best marketplace in the future, but they have the foundation for what we want to build and do better.

I don't see any more questions. üòÑ

**Ryan:** No. We covered all of the questions. We covered what we're going to be focusing on and working towards in the near future and a little bit in the long term. I know I'm incredibly excited about what's coming, and I hope everyone else is. I know I will see you guys in 2 weeks on this call.

**Nick:** If you're listening on YouTube, guys like and subscribe, share with your friends and make sure you're posting listings on Universe and telling your friends to do the same. That's what helps us. It's community marketing instead of the paid stuff that some people want.

**Algy:** Listing your NFTs on Universe is smart, you are saving money if it gets swept on Gem as a seller. Listing on OpenSea or Looks Rare is ineffective if you're trying to make as much money possible off your NFTs because they're going to get bought in the same place regardless, and you could be saving on fees. 

That guy Max Stealth, he sweeps. Every time he sweeps, he uses Gem. 

If you guys were listing your Flufs on Universe. When somebody like Max Stealth sweeps the floor, you would be making more money having that listed on Universe instead. (Lower fees) 

I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I'm just stating that you're effectively losing money listing on other websites because people are buying on Gem regardless. You guys all know this. That's why you're in the AMA. ü§ù

**Ryan:** Thanks, everyone. ‚úåÔ∏è

**Rayne:** Cheers! 

Everyone. Bye. üëã
