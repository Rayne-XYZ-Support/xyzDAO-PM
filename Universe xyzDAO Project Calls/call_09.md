## Intro [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/e-WTjMysyHY)

**Mark:** Hey, everyone! Welcome to project call number 9 for xyzDAO.

We'd like to give a special birthday shoutout to our main man Viacheslav! üéä

V's been with us for a while‚Äî he's been with Tyler for the longest. He's one of Tyler's oldest employees, and today is his birthday.

So, everyone, wish V a happy birthday! ü•≥ üéâ

I'll go ahead and hand it over to Dragos so he can give updates around the DAO and governance.

## DAO & Governance [[00:38]](https://youtu.be/e-WTjMysyHY?t=38)

**Dragos:** Thank you very much, Mark!

Hello, everyone! 

Pretty briefly‚Äî I think I'll share my screen because it will be easier that way. 

The first thing, which I think everyone is excited about; The DAO governance is live. The DAO got activated because our threshold passed. 

So, a round of applause for that, I suppose! üëè

**Screen sharing starts**

With that said, we prepared the signal page and the forum. They are up!

You can go to: [signal.universe.xyz/#/](https://signal.universe.xyz/#/) (for snapshots)

That's where you can propose something and see how it will go before suggesting it directly to the DAO. 

The Discourse is where you'll talk about the proposals: [forum.universe.xyz](https://forum.universe.xyz) (for discussion)

Those are both live! And likely later today, we'll push a patch release that adds the links to the tabs in the app so you can navigate to those pages quickly. 

Other than that. Since the DAO got activated‚Äî the docs about governance and how to create a proposal got added. (scroll to the bottom of the universe.xyz ‚Äì there's a column named info, select 'docs')

It's in the info section, and if you click docs, it will bring you to the documents: [docs.universe.xyz/](https://docs.universe.xyz/)

There is an overview and the idea behind xyzDAO. [How to create a proposal](https://docs.universe.xyz/proposals-and-voting) etc. 

The documentation is well written. (on how to do anything)

- How to form a proposal/format one. 

- What do the states of a proposal look like? 

- How a proposal passes

Long story short. I think that is all. Unless anyone has anything else to add? Please, go ahead. 

If not, then we can move forward and talk about auctions and such. 

**Mark:** Yes, I believe that's everything that we needed to discuss. 

**Dragos:** Cool! 

The website link is: [dao.universe.xyz](https://dao.universe.xyz)

**Screen sharing ends**

**Mark:** Nice!

## Auctions and Minting [[03:03]](https://youtu.be/e-WTjMysyHY?t=183)

**Mark:** I can go over some of the auctions and minting updates.

So, currently, we have our auctions and minting going through their second round of audits. In the last few weeks, we've made some adjustments, and over the previous few days, Certik has begun auditing all of our contracts. Right now, we are in limbo until they get back to us.

We hope all that comes back clear, and then we can connect to them and start testing all of that. We have done extensive testing. I know Stan has done a ridiculous amount of testing on what we already have. But, once we get the backend and everything live. The site will need more testing to ensure there are no bugs or issues. Where people can lose things or the site doesn't work as intended. 

We need to make sure that all of that works‚Äî which will take us a bit of time. But, if all goes to plan. Hopefully, we'll be launching all of that soon. We don't have a date in mind, and we don't want to get too ahead of ourselves because we do not know what's coming back from these audits. However, if they come back clean and things are looking good. Then we should have the ability to launch according to plan. That's soon. 

We'll leave it at that. 

## Polymorph Rarity Charts [[04:41]](https://youtu.be/e-WTjMysyHY?t=281)

**Mark:** We've also been working on a ton of things for Polymorphs. It's nearly a month since they dropped. (I'm not sure if they are even at 1-month old)

I think they are 28/29 days old. But, we've been working on a rarity chart. It's been tough to pull off, but we've finally got it to where we want. The tools reflect entire sets and exactly how we thought the rarity chart would go best with the Polymorph design. 

The only thing that we are waiting on for that is finishing up the frontend interface. We've created a pretty sleek rarity tools style site. It will get located at [universe.xyz.](https://universe.xyz) Essentially, rarity tools could not offer a chart for Polymorphs. So we had to build a site for them. You'll have the ability to filter and search based on traits.

You can sort them via rarity: #1 - #10,000

or 

You can sort them via certain traits/skins. 

Whatever angle you are trying to view them. The filtering will be exceptional. You'll have the ability to click and view everyone's Polymorph. One thing that our site does not have‚Äî the ability to check out other people's Polymorphs. You have to type in the URL and then affix the token number to the end.

ex; [universe.xyz/polymorphs/6729 <-- Polymorph #](https://universe.xyz/polymorphs/6729)

Allowing for people to go through all the Polymorphs, click on them. See their properties, if they are a virgin and what badges they have. (we are working on more badges)

There is that disconnect right now on Opensea. People are trying to figure out if a Polymorph is a virgin or not. They can see them, but they want to know more. Has it been scrambled? What's the cost to scramble?

A few things someone may want to know before they go and ape into one on the market. So, we are trying to get all that information readily available to you all. Those pages will be clickable from the rarity chart, and you'll be able to see every Polymorph. It will be a good way to go through and see them all in one place‚Äî with filters and such. You'll get to see all the badges easier.

Lastly, for the rarity chart, the formula took a bit too long. We thought we had it right. But, we had to look back and revise it. We got it fixed. We need to get the front end up and connect to the back end. Then we'll be there. There are a few more finishing touches before we release the rarity tools.

Another thing, partly why the rarity tools have taken so long‚Äî we had to reallocate a few resources. 

## Polymorphs (Mark) [[08:03]](https://youtu.be/e-WTjMysyHY?t=483)

One thing we've started doing over the last few weeks; rebuilding our teams. We have around 30-40 people working on Universe. And we're working on around 9 or 10 different things. So, it's a bit difficult when we have tons of requests for new features for Polymorphs. 

There was a slight scramble to move things around to build out rarity tools and other features for Polymorphs. We've started building a lot for them. We didn't want to stop at an NFT drop. As we said, these are some of the most technologically advanced NFTs we've seen thus far.

So, we want to keep building more for them. One thing we're working on right now is a battle game. It will allow you to take your Polymorph and battle against each other. (with potential wagers)

We have a gladiator-style of Polymorphs fighting each other.

Also, Limchain is working on a game for Polymorphs. It's called Morph Land. Stan, do you want to explain Morph Land? Or Z? 

You guys can probably explain it better than I can. I describe it as a Risk, Minecraft, conquer type game. You need to conquer the land, and whoever controls the most wins. 

Maybe Z can give a better take.

**Z:** Yeah, I can give a slight overview. I can say with a caveat that we're still early. It's subject to change. We're still in the ideation phase and working on different possibilities. 

The idea is to have a Minecraft-style game. Each Polymorph will get land. And it can also conquer and explore new lands based on their attributes/traits. That's it. And it's subjected to change!

**Mark:** Then there is a winner! Almost like a conquer-all-to-win game. (king of the hill)

It sounds like a ton of fun. We're working on it. 

Also, some people already know, we are working on new art for the Polymorphs. Tyler has called it v2 burn to mint drops.

If you don't like the current Polymorph art, you could burn it for a different version. Right now, we are working on two Polymorphic drops. One has already started, and another is still in the works.

The first type is a 3D-styled Polymorph. (you may have already seen it floating around Twitter)

We are making the Polymorphs a bit more realistic‚Äî giving them a more 3D look. You'll get the ability to burn your Polymorph in exchange for the same image. (In 3D) 

I believe that's how it works. You'll get a new version of your Polymorph. The catch is, the second burn to mint Polymorph can still get scrambled.

So, we're still bringing cool, interesting, ideas for how we can make these Polymorphs change.

The other drop we're working on, we haven't started yet. But, we're considering opening this drop to the community. Allowing for artists to come in and help curate a burn to mint Polymorph drop. 

We have an idea about a face with sections, and perhaps we get ten or more artists to take a commission to do a few of these faces. Then we'd have Polymorphic artistic faces that are a conglomerate of varying artists. That would be one of our first community drops on Universe. It allows the community to get more involved with us.

That's something that we are interested in and actively exploring. So, reach out to me on Discord and Twitter. (If that's something you are interested in doing as an artist)

I'm not able to find you guys. The easiest way for you to get ahold of me is to send me a direct message. I'm nice. I'll message you back!

I'm pretty busy, so If I don't message you right away, I'll still get back to you. 

Also, other things we are working on for the Polymorphs‚Äî as I alluded to earlier. We built out an entire team to work on this stuff for the Polymorphs because we were a bit overwhelmed with all of this stuff. At first, we got overwhelmed‚Äî because of the sell-out. Then it was the community and how they embraced the Polymorphs and loved them. Then it was the demand for rarity tools. (just one thing after another) 

So, we figured the best thing to do was; build out a team to explore all these different ideas. And part of what that team is doing is exploring metaverse capabilities. (aiming for getting the Polymorphs into the metaverse)

It looks like something that we can do‚Äî 100%. So, we've started working with 3D artists that can create the specific files needed for putting Polymorphs in the metaverse. We didn't have anyone to design 3D. (except V ‚Äî he knows how to do 3D) 

If any of you guys know, V does everything. We call him our night ninja or swiss army knife. He performs any task that we ask of him. However, we can't put V on one thing. We need him for a bunch of stuff. So, we've built out a small 3D team to design the Polymorphs for the metaverse.

We've also had massive internal discussions about creating a Polymorph clubhouse. Essentially a rebrand of the UI. (a bit like the Bored Apes) We love that style of how they created a homey feel. 

If you go to their website: [BAYC Website](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/)

Whoever their designer was, they did a great job creating an immersive feel when you go to their website. A few of these collections are building a clubhouse or a Decentraland clubhouse‚Äî general clubhouses for the metaverse. (this is something we'd like to explore) 

One thing we've been looking at‚Äî Decentraland and Sandbox.

We are looking if there are any plots set aside that Universe could potentially purchase with DAO funds. We can get a few land plots. Or maybe buy a section where if you hold a Polymorph, you're eligible to acquire it. We haven't had these conversations yet. (with either team) 

But, we are reaching out and trying to get in touch with them. So we can have these conversations. A lot of this is only in the idea phase. However, they are ideas that I'm sure both the community and the team would like to pursue.

It's definitely on our radar.

**Tyler:** One thing that Z brought up. A Twitter poll, and perhaps this is where we start conversations around governance. 

What metaverse plot or platform do we use?

Those discussions can take place in Discord. But, I think using the forum is a good first move for this. It's worked quite well for BarnBridge. We have engaging discussions. So, there's an opportunity to showcase that.

**Tyler:** Yeah! It's kind of perfect. 

**Troy:** It will also help organize it. Because Discord can be slightly chaotic, a forum will be a good place to reference or go through a conversation. I'm not sure about you guys, but I get lost in some of those conversations on Discord.

**Troy:** Yeah, the Discord has gotten pretty crazy since we split it up as; xyz & Polymorphs. 

**Tyler:** It's not just our Discord. It's Discord in general. When we first started with BarnBridge and when Synthetix first started‚Äî everyone was using Telegram. A lot of people moved to Discord because of the bots that can get integrated. The way you can segment things via channels. There are better ways to organize. 

But, now, as Discord has grown substantially across our entire industry. It's not something that can get used for layering governance discussions. That's why we have a forum, snapshot & DAO. We still need a place that organizes the information in a digestible format.  

**Mark:** I personally (for the metaverse conversation) have only explored those different games a little bit. I'm unsure which is best, to be honest. I would need to research them individually to figure it out. But, we'd love to hear from the community.

What do you guys think? What do you play? 

What are the pros and cons to both?

Some of us know, but not all of us. I think everyone has varying opinions. It's a great example of a first run. These ideas can get started in the forums, and discussions can take place there. If it's something the community wants to do‚Äî we can host a snapshot to decide. 

We can sort out what plot we would like to purchase or game; Decentraland or Sandbox. 

A decision can get made via voting on a snapshot. As Tyler said, it's a perfect time and opportunity to get‚Äî what you would say, the flows or the motions of governance started. üåä‚öôÔ∏è

**Tyler:** Yeah, let's start the governance processes. It will help. The NFT community is not following how DeFi handles governance. And I think this is an opportunity to open a lot of people's eyes.

**Mark:** I think you're making a great point! There are several people in the community‚Äî especially Universe ‚Äîsaying: Polymorphs are their first NFT. XYZ is one of their first yield farming experiences. 

I think that there is a ton to learn. Governance is the next step towards decentralization. I remember learning about yield farming. I believe BarnBridge was the first governance token that I farmed for yield. It was a truly eye-opening experience. Even when I learned about that stuff months ago, it wakes you up and changes how you think of these new systems. (versus our older traditional systems)

I feel I need to share that experience! I grew after learning about governance and using it for the first time. I think everyone can learn from it, as Tyler said. 

That's essentially all that we have for today. 

We can turn to community questions!

## Community Questions [[22:10]](https://youtu.be/e-WTjMysyHY?t=1330)
(questions from Discord in channel #project-management-calls)

**Mark:** We can turn to the questions. We don't have many‚Äî it looks like there is one.

vj2006 wants us to know if we can discuss the recent gas wars regarding the Stoner Cats and the Vogu drop. Do we have any plans to address those issues as part of our platform? 

I guess Matic and others are the solutions to this problem?

Does anyone want to talk about that? Can we talk about it?

I can answer the part about our platform and if we'll be able to fix that.

**Troy:** The majority of that will depend on layer two if we end up minting there. Even Polymorphs had a slight gas war. That's a symptom of the network. Stoner Cats slightly messed up on a few other things as well. There is no silver bullet.

**Mark:** That is one thing we are certainly exploring. We've had conversations with external teams. There have been calls with teams like Immutable X and Polygon. (we're still on calls with Polygon) 

We're exploring layer two solutions. But, right now, in the beginning, we want to build everything on layer one and then layer two will come next. We'll plug them in, and those abilities will become available. But Troy's right. It's a burden of the Ethereum network. 

Once things scale and move to layer two and use solutions like Optimism. Hopefully, gas wars won't happen to the extent they happen now. After some transactions are off layer one and onto layer two, large gas spikes should get prevented.

We can fix some of these things as an entire community. (gas is not something that is in our control) It's a conglomerate for everyone. 

That's the only question we had! 

Keep dropping questions! In the last few weeks, we haven't had many. We love all the questions. I guess that means we are doing a good job of answering questions in Discord. 

Alright, guys! I think that's everything we have. 

Is there anything we want to say to our beautiful followers?

**Troy:** I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts in the forum. 

**Mark:** Let us know! I'll start a thread about what metaverse we should look at‚Äî Decentraland or Sandbox.
