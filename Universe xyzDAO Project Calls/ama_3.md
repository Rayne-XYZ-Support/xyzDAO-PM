Attendees: Mark Ward, Tyler Ward, Troy Murray, Ryan Shtirmer, Algernon (Young Algy), Nick Ward, Rayne Leach , Zach Owens

## Intro

**Ryan:** All right, guys, sorry about that. I was getting organized. We're going to begin our 23rd project call. We're doing these as AMAs now, so it's going to be a lot more fun and interactive. We have a few things on the agenda today, so we'll cover a couple of little updates. Then we can jump into answering some questions with the community. You can feel free to post your questions in the hashtag Pre AMA channel throughout the call or wait till later and start posting them as we start answering the questions.

**Nick:** Don't forget to mute your mic as you join in, guys. It'll make everything cooler because we're recording this call, and we don't want background noise and stuff.

**Ryan:** Awesome. Thank you, Nick. 

## Proposals [[00:45]](https://youtu.be/GtuncSFIZEM?t=45) üó≥

**Ryan:** So the first thing I wanted to talk about a little bit was the proposals that we'll be putting out soon. So we're going to start making a little bit of the snapshot to get some hot, cold tests and decisions that don't need to be on-chain, decisions that don't need to be finalized on-chain. 

1. So one proposal you'll be seeing coming out shortly is going to be a proposal to put together an OpenSea migration tool so that users can migrate their existing OpenSea orders to the Universe Marketplace. This snapshot will start gauging how much the Universe community is willing to incentivize migration behaviour and whether we want to mint any tokens or come up with some strategy to incentivize that. 
2. Another proposal which I'm excited about is the proposal to freeze the polymorph base characters. So what this means is if this proposal goes through when the V2 polymorphs launch, you'll be able to scramble and morph your polymorphs just like before. But any base character traits will not be scrambleable. 

   - So if you're scrambling a Ragnarok, for example, you'll still have a Ragnarok just with new traits or a clown; you scramble it, you still have a clown, but with new traits.

So this kind of gives the polymorphs a little bit of a fixed rarity on some dimension, but across the accessory dimension, the rarity is kind of not immutable. It will continue to be dynamic and morph. 

## Minting, Auctions & Marketplace Updates [[02:14]](https://youtu.be/GtuncSFIZEM?t=134) üñº üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

**Ryan:** We can jump in a little bit into the Minting, Auctions and Marketplace Updates. 

As I mentioned, we're architecting the user incentives models, and again, that's going to be with strong feedback from the community. We're going to need you guys not to guide us but more feed on how important you all believe this incentivization is and how much we want to allocate towards that kind of stuff. Another thing we've been very focused on is improving the APIs for use with aggregators. We believe this is very important to get our listings prioritized across the aggregator markets and compete in this new dimension. That other marketplaces have not yet really started competing over. So we hope to be kind of a leader on that front. And as kind of mentioned before, we're working on some final little updates in the Auctions Contracts. So those are hopefully going to be coming out in the next 2 weeks.

And the marketplace is on track for around 4 to 5 weeks out. 

## Yield Farming [[03:07]](https://youtu.be/GtuncSFIZEM?t=188) üßë‚Äçüåæ üåæ

**Ryan:** As Mark likes to usually tell you guys about the Yield Farming opportunities, I pulled out a couple that we have. 

1. The first one and the one that we're really excited to share is the DAO governance. When you stake in the DAO and receive your XYZ, you earn some rewards for participating in the governance process. So that's always a lot of fun. 

2. Additionally, you can single-sided stake your XYZ for [League DAO](https://dao.leaguedao.com/yield-farming) for about 3 more weeks, and the [Enter DAO](https://dao.enterdao.xyz/yield-farming) farms have ended. 

3. There's an ASTO pool coming soon, but I don't have the start date for that pool. So if anyone is interested in that, you can tag Mark for more information there. 

That covers the major updates we have going to have for the beginning of the call, so we can mostly jump into any questions that anyone wants answered. 

Then in a little bit, we'll be doing some fun activities.

**Algy:** What's up, Chuba? I think that Mark is travelling right now.

**Ryan:** Yeah, Mark's out so we can get some questions flowing, and we'll be able to start answering those.

**Algy:** Okay, nice. 

So let's look at that channel because there's a question where they type in Pre AMA Channel.

**Ryan:** Yeah, the Pre AMA Channel.

## Polymorphs [[04:37]](https://youtu.be/GtuncSFIZEM?t=277) ü§°

**Algy:** Here. Let's scroll up and see if we have some new ones. We talked in here a bunch, so we didn't get many questions. If you have any questions, drop the Pre AMA Channel. 

We've been working a lot on these 3D polymorphs for you guys. I know that people have asked me questions about what's going on with the Polymorphs. For some reason, everybody wants to ask me if the Polymorphs are related. Look at this person just did it before I even said I couldn't answer that because I don't know.

I don't know if the Polymorphs will be related to Goblin Town. But regardless, that's going to be super cool, whatever it is, because it seems like the people who are working on it are people I know that are awesome builders. 

What I was about to say about the Polymorphs that I can talk about is we've been playing around with the 3Ds and getting them ready for Metaverse and this second phase of making them more gamed out and more fun to play. When that's all released, it's going to be exciting because we just have some cool stuff in the pipeline, like alternative art pieces that we'll be able to play around with.

The 3D specifically, we fine-tune those every day. We were looking at them on a call in-depth today, just picking out little ways we could improve the art and stuff. As soon as the marketplace is out, we have a lot of really cool NFT stuff in the pipeline for everybody to have fun with. I want to bet my rent in ETH on a Universe Algy duel. 

Honestly, there's that battle game I can talk about a little bit because I know that some of you maybe weren't here when we first introduced it. We have this battle game coming soon that is going not to be fully attached to the rarity because the rarity on our site, the community, asked us to make it based on matching traits, so the best Polymorphs will be the ones that are matching. They don't necessarily have to be ready for this battle game we're creating. The first game that we have started on is this battle game where depending on how to set up your character is, he'll be better at fighting. So that doesn't necessarily mean more armour and weapons are better, but for the most part, it is.

For that game, it still will be very random-based. The advantages are very slight, but it'll make it more fun as far as giving you something to go for to get better at that game. But that doesn't mean that you should make your Polymorph like, set up for this game and make all your Polymorphs battle-ready. Because we want to make a lot of different types of games that are good for all the trades, if that makes sense, maybe the soccer outfit will be better for you at another game we release down the line if that makes sense.

**Ryan:** Yes, I think Algy. You're highlighting a bit of the different dimensions of the Polymorphs; even though they have a rarity based on the matching traits, games like the duals will have their kind of metrics and attributes for what actually will impact gameplay. It's not going to look exactly like that rarity score. So there will ultimately be a different dynamic for the game and then for other potentially different things we put out there.

**Algy:** When we first released the Polymorphs, something that made me obsessed with them because I bought like 60 polymorphs. When I didn't have that much ETH, that was a lot for me to be buying that many, I spent all my money on them, and it was because what I liked about them was when I got into NFTs, the Crypto Punks were kind of already expensive. They were like 10 to 15 ETH and just a little out of my range. I couldn't buy one of those. 

But many projects were still figuring out what the market was going to be. Then as one started to release with this rarity thing, it just seems so obvious to us why can none of these change and adjust? It was cool how when the Polymorphs came out, they challenged the market dynamic and got people thinking about, well, I should be able to make this NFT look how I want it to look. Because most projects, the rarity is chosen for you and told what you should be going for.

You don't get to decide. I want to have this character that looks like how I want it to look, and it can still be rare. I feel like the Polymorphs were the first project that allowed you to have a character that looks how you want and it can still be rare is what I was bullish on when I was aping the polymorphs, and I still am. And that it would be cool eventually to add more rarity-driven traits and maybe different dynamics on new traits if that's possible. 

It would also be cool to fork the Polymorph and make other projects based on something similar‚Äî like how League DAO is doing it with their Crypto Fantasy Drop. It will eventually be scrambling where you can have this fantasy team where you're competing against other holders. Next year you're going to be able to change your team though this year, you couldn't do that. That's just cool that the polymorphs were introduced. I've even heard [Aaron](https://twitter.com/aaronmcdnz) say that his projects that change, The Party Bears and The FLUFs, are based a bit on the Polymorphs, it got everyone thinking. 

Eventually, in the Metaverse, when you play Call of Duty or Fortnite or even FIFA or any game, you want to customize your team, and you've always been able to do that even early on in Madden and like you would create a player.

And I think that this customizability is super important in NFTs because it's something that we've always done gaming, and it's not something that we want to stop doing. So making your NFT project change, in my opinion, is a very progressive way to build an NFT out, and it might not be the current market, but it's without question that it's going to be what people want when they're able to play games. Because right now, there is not realistic. Right now, the reality is we are just trading in NFTs. There are no games yet, but when the games exist, we're going to want to be able to go in the game and alter our experience, if that makes sense.

**Ryan:** Yeah, I 100% agree. So many people are leaking pictures of different Charles in the chat and all the different Polymorphs variations. It's just cool to see how a year ago these things came out, and now there's this whole community around them and all this incredible aesthetic, a little scary art, that we all enjoy and identify with to some degree or another. I know this most recent clown that Mark posted is when I've been using it in many of my tweets because it greatly encaptures everything I want to say.

**Zach:** Yeah. I don't know why. Every time I go into the blender with the 3D Charles, it ends up scary.

## Pre AMA Questions ‚ùì

### **Question:**

What is the timeline for the airdrop proposal if we are planning to launch in a month fully? 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** So the plan is that there's a usable beta out in a month. This will be live on the mainnet and usable, but the incentivization model maybe 1, 2, 3 weeks after. Once we're comfortable with the product, everyone's using it. We're able to be like, okay, it's time to start incentivizing people to move over here, so we don't have to launch it exactly on day one of the marketplaces being out, but we do hope it's launched very shortly after.

**Algy:** I don't think we've released it to the community yet, but we have this tool that we've been playing with. That's how you see these images that Mark is sending, and it's this tool we made that gives us the ability to scramble.

**Ryan:** Don't share it.

**Algy:** Okay.

But I was saying that projects got to think more about how they can game out their NFTs because there are many ways to make it fun for the community. And as Chuba said, I shouldn't leak anything. 

But yeah, there's so much fun stuff in the pipeline. I'm not sharing it. You guys almost got me. I heard Chuba, though. I listen. Suppose he doesn't want me to say it, then yeah. As I said, there's much more cool stuff we have in the pipeline that is just going to be so fun for the Polymorph. They're already just fun to look at, so it makes sense. There's another thing I just want to talk about, but I probably shouldn't. But just know that there'll be a lot of fun stuff for you to watch and do and enjoy in the future with the polymorph. I guess I can't talk about we want to do some fun stuff on social media, too, with bringing the polymorphs to life. I can say that that will be cool when we start doing that.

Look at when Universe goes live. We want to get off the BrokenSea. I use BrokenSea or OpenSea every day, and I don't think it's broken. I feel that they weren't expecting such a huge number of people to use NFTs as soon and as suddenly as they did. There's going to be room for everybody. I don't think that we must be trying to get rid of OpenSea. It's more a community-building type of vibes. OpenSea can exist too and learn from us the same way we can learn from them. I want Transmental to talk about what he's talking about.

## Auction Mechanics [[16:03]](https://youtu.be/GtuncSFIZEM?t=963) üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

**Ryan:** The Auction Mechanics.

**Zach:** Yes. I don't know how much I can say, but I played at the Auction a lot, and I think it's something new for NFT space that hasn't been seen before.

**Ryan:** We can probably say that I know you've used it a lot, so that you can confirm. You probably can't come up with all the different ways you could use it. Right?

**Zach:** Right. There are many layers. üßÖ

**Trevor:** You can configure it in so many different ways. You can choose to do these crazy multi NFT drops. You can stick limit it to just one or two. You can go for many different things. Whatever works within a set of rules there are in there that I don't think any of us can predict exactly how it will be used. So there are some different use cases we predict with this kind of tiered auction model, some of them being just collectors trying to find price discovery for their art. Others could be auctioning off these crazy art blocks collections, a collection of rare FLUFs, or else you may be interested in bundling and weird things. But then there are individual NFTs taking a shirtless Clown Charles and seeing what that can go for. Like one NFT, all different kinds of basic ways of creating an auction. And so it's very flexible.

**Zach:** Yeah. I think I mainly look at the options from an artist's perspective because I shoot photographs. But as an artist with work that hasn't been sold yet, using it, like Chuba said, as a price discovery method will be exciting for artists. And then, from a collector standpoint, I'm sure you can auction off 100 or 500 NFTs at one time in different tiers. It's going to be cool.

**Ryan:** Yeah. I'd love to auction off 100 P5.JS things I've been toying with, but the arc probably will never be good enough for me to be. I'm ready to drop it. Yeah. One day. Interactive P5 stuff is so much fun. But I don't think we have any alpha we can leak on that front. On the Universe side, not today, at least.

**Tyler:** What's up, everybody? What did I miss? I'm just kidding. You don't have to catch me up. 

I'm just saying. What's up? üëã

**Algy:** Great to have you, Tyler. ü§ù

**Nick:** What about Tyler?

**Tyler:** How's it going? Sorry, I'm late. I just had some. Troy and I had a call. That was important.

**Ryan:** All good. We went through some of the Community Updates that we had, and then we're going back to the community a little bit in the Pre AMA Channel.

**Algy:** Universe just dropped this tweet from the [Riyuki NFT](https://twitter.com/Riyuki_nft), and it talks about how they're saying that we're a partnership with Universe. 

So basically, what's going on here is our friend [Endgame](https://twitter.com/endygamie) from the community releasing an NFT project and he wanted to donate half the money to Universe. It wasn't to have us help him build it necessarily just for us to say this exists. Endgame wanted it to be one of the first projects released on our Minting and Marketplace Platform. So we just thought that was cool‚Äîall power to anybody who wants to support the DAO. 

Of course, we don't expect this. That's cool that Endgame decided that was something they wanted to do‚Äî this project. 

**Tyler:** I wanted to clarify, by the way, that this is the Endgame, who was supportive of our project from the very beginning. He's a very involved community member that came over from Barnbridge. So a big part of this is especially for the super active community members. We ultimately want to support and empower people who have followed and stuck with us, and we're extremely helpful initially.

**Algy:** Yeah, exactly. That drop. I don't know exactly. I've been talking to him about it, and it seems like it'll be cool. The art is amazing, and it seems different. I know it's in its early stages. I'm in this little channel where there's an activity every day, and they have a pretty severe team working on it. So we'll see how it turns out. You'll hear more about it, though, when our Marketplace drops because that's where they want it to sell and trade. 

That's just cool to me that Endgame is working on that and believes in us because I think it's a cool project. It is Waifu, so I hope no one gets offended by it. It's more about just the concept that that person was an early contributor who is just trying to give back. A lot of Universe, me as well, when I first started helping with Universe, I was offering to help for free. And it's just because it's helped change my life. Even if that sounds corny, I want to get back in any way I can, if that makes sense. So I can relate to it.

**Tyler:** I'm also working on a custom drop for the Polymorph. 

I have not told anyone that I've self-funded up to this point. I'm going to give 100% of the proceeds to the DAO. Hopefully, the DAO and community will allow me to vote that out to myself to compensate an army of 3D modellers and gaming people I've been recruiting for the past 2 months. To build a Metaverse for the Polymorphs. And we'll call it redacted because I'm not going to tell anybody what the name is. 

I haven't brought it to the Universe team other than a few members because I don't want anyone distracted while working on the marketplace. But I will say that it's dope AF, and that's what I want to do with the capital from the drop. So I think it's in everybody's best interest because I want us to have a cool-ass Metaverse. But that is super alpha. And yeah, ultimately, the DAO can decide if they will allow me to use those funds to compensate this army of people that I've been recruiting.

**Algy:** Yeah. I have no idea what Tyler is talking about, but I get what he just said. Yeah, exactly. So he's not making that up. He's been working on something. He's been busy.

**Tyler:** I gave Goblin Town to FLUF World because it was too close to something they're working on, and I want it to look and feel more like a Polymorph type thing. 

So, yeah, the Polymorphs will be a part of this Metaverse. If all of this is successful long-term, I'll probably want to build Lobby Lobsters into it, but no promises. It's not going to be cheap‚Äî what I'm trying to build.

**Ryan:** Yeah. I don't know all the details or any of that, but I know I'm voting yes, so that's going to be fun.

**Algy:** Wait, so what did Troy show us? He made a whole channel to show us something during the AMA. I want to know.

**Troy:** Can you hear me?

**Nick:** Yeah, we can hear you.

**Troy:** So there's this group that we're working with down here in Puerto Rico, but they have this really big idea for NFTs and everything. One of the things I did want to bring up on this call is that we are a global community, they're looking for NFT creators around the globe, and we will be having a PR release from them pretty soon that breaks this down. But I wanted to create a channel so that anyone in here if you are an NFT artist somewhere around the world, should contact these people. They have right now a mint going on for one of their drops. It isn't like an official Universe thing or anything, but it plays into the ethos of what we've been trying to build. 

And so they have really large plans, and it starts with NFT drops and artists and stuff like that. So I just wanted to bring some attention to it. There will be like I said, a PR release soon. We talked with them yesterday, and I'm pretty excited about it.

If you're anywhere on the globe, they want to have different places around the globe all working on this. So, I have to leave it because I don't have all the details of what they're writing up the release, but I wanted to just kind of flag it so everyone knew that this thing was coming, and it's a cool idea.

**Tyler:** When Beanie left, did that art chick leave too?

**Algy:** I don't follow that person, but probably no; I think that person doxed herself, and it's a girl.

**Tyler:** Interesting. I would have doxed myself, too, if everybody thought I was Beanie after all that stuff came out.

**Algy:** Yeah, I think that she did it a while ago now.

**Tyler:** Beanie was hella entertaining; I'll give them that much. I mean, I don't want to get involved. I'm sure there are two sides to every story, but that was pretty damning.

**Algy:** I can't lie. Hit him with the unfollow. But we followed each other until I figured out about what leaked. 

But as far as more Universe Updates, Tyler, I think that you got to have more alpha that you can link us on. I don't think anyone has talked about the status or explained how the auctions will work. In general, or the status of when those are coming, that is the thing. Everything's coming soon. Like no specific date.

**Tyler:** So we won't know the timeline for the auctions until probably Friday because the scraper will be affected by it, and it's going to depend on how complete the scraper is. From an API perspective, the marketplace right now is probably, in the short term, more important than auctions. And if we have to put all hands on deck, and instead of delaying the marketplace, we should delay the auctions because 2 separate teams are working on them. But we won't know based on what Ryan got back. We have a good feeling that we won't have to delay anything or change anything. So the reason that we have not released the launch date for the auctions is that we need to make sure that the auctions don't delay the marketplace. So it's contingent on incomplete information, and we'll know more by Friday. As far as the dope features of the Auctions, I think that Transmental is the most extremely excited about auctions. So I would rather.

**Nick:** He had already went over some things, but he didn't know what he could or couldn't say. I mainly like talking about content features, but I think we can tell.

**Tyler:** Close to launching. I don't care if nobody's going to be able to rebuild it.

**Troy:** What are you worried about saying?

**Zach:** I didn't know what I could say and what I couldn't say about auctions.

**Troy:** I don't think there's anything to worry about. To be honest, it seems like we got through. Just so everyone's aware there. It was an issue that the contracts for the auctions would go over the byte limit for an Ethereum Contract, but it seems like we have gotten past that. Ryan, would you agree with that?

**Ryan:** Yeah, I'm still confirming the functionality, but I don't think that will be a huge problem.

**Troy:** Yeah. So I don't think we need to worry about it that much. It's not like anyone's coming up, so I think it's open. We can talk about it, right?

**Zach:** I mean, I kind of said everything I wanted to say. I didn't go into detail about the tier system, which I think is the most exciting part.

**Nick:** Even if it's delayed, everything we're about to drop auctions is launching within 30 days. We don't see any major blockers, so nobody's going to build that in 30 days. They'd have to be the best Dev Team in the world. It's not going to happen.

**Algy:** Okay. One thing I wanted to say. I would like to explain the auctions and how the auctions will work. Is it okay for us to talk because it's a sick dynamic?

**Nick:** I can talk about everything about the auctions that anyone knows about because, like I'm saying, we can drop all the alpha in the world, and nobody's going to be able to build it between now and when we drop the auctions.

**Algy:** Yeah. I think the auction information is put somewhere in a doc. But basically, the auctions have this cool style, and I think everybody already knows that there will be zero fees taken out on the primary sale. It's going to be amazing. When you go in Universe right now, it's just that one minting page is cool, and it's cool to use, but I think most people and most artists would say just in their head like there should be more features to this, and we know that. And we have a lot of really cool like Lazy Minting, Pack Minting that I probably shouldn't explain. But also these auctions. The auctions themselves have a cool dynamic where you're able to split your auction up into tiers and have you could do a regular auction with 1 item. That's fine. But you also have the ability to do an auction where it has tiers, and each tier is going to have different items. So it's like layers on layers. You could do an auction where you sell 3 NFTs on 1st tier, and the winner gets those 3 NFTs. The 2nd tier could maybe get 1 NFT, and it's a different item. Then the 3rd tier could get 2 NFTs if you wanted.

**Zach:** You can almost have tiers inside the tiers.

**Algy:** Yeah, because you can get more than 1 NFT, you can break it down for a pretty long time. The way the auctions are set up. We have it set up to where it's pretty simplified to where it will make sense more visually when you're looking at it, but all of our minting tools, we've thought out a lot. And right now, the one that exists is pretty basic, and we know that, but that's the only one we can offer until our marketplaces out. Otherwise, the other new ones won't function to their full functionality. So we have a lot of really cool stuff lined up, and a lot of it's coming together because it has to. So it'll be a lot when we start releasing stuff. There'll be many options for artists and functionality. The auctions, in my opinion, are going to be game-changing for a new, fun way to buy NFTs.

**Zach:** With the auctions, one of the cool features and being able to design your own Custom Auction Landing Page. They look really beautiful, so you'll have a landing page like Universe.XYZ/auctions, whatever you want to name it, you can customize that, and it looks great. 

So it's not just an auction on Universe.XYZ. It's like your own custom landing page, whether you're a collector or an artist.

**Algy:** That's how all the contracts are designed, unlike Minting Features that companies have available right now, which is not all of them. I think there are some ways to comment as close to decentralized NFTs, but Universe NFTs are designed to be as decentralized as possible. So you own them. And I'm not saying that you don't own your NFTs, but you own them in every aspect, let's say they're under your control, as much as they can be to that NFT contracts limits.

**Nick:** You're the god of your NFT.

**Algy:** Yeah, exactly. I'm not going to sit here and bash others. But the one I will point out, just because it is a fact and people should be aware when you buy an NFT off OpenSeas Shared Contracts, look at the NFT. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is a thing. It's on the Pixel Of The Apes. That's a project I love. So it's not like I'm saying this is a bad or good thing, but I'm pretty sure they legally have to do this. If you look at the NFT on their website, in the details, it says metadata. Centralized is the description of their metadata, and it shows this on any OpenSea NFT; I think the only reason I could think of why they have that on there is for legal reasons. If it was a Universe NFT, I'm almost certain it would say decentralized.

**Zach:** Yeah, I'm pretty sure it won't say anything at all. It'll say chain ETH.

**Algy:** I am not bashing OpenSea when I say that. I'm just stating a fact that's something people should be aware of when they're buying an NFT. If they didn't have it on there, I wouldn't be able to say that.

**Zach:** No, I feel you, Algy, because I'll see art sometimes, and then I'll look at the details for the NFT. It always kind of turns me off seeing centralized metadata.

**Algy:** Yeah. I know that some collectors don't even know what any of this means and don't care about this. But I think that most artists, especially those who do digital art, will know what I'm talking about and care about this on-chain stuff and own their art. 

**Zach:** All right, should we drop this POAP code?

**Algy:** Yeah, we can drop the POAP code once right now. The code if you go into POAP claim channel. But I do want to address what Troy's like messaging in this Pre AMA channel. We can say it again after.

**Zach:** Go to the POAP setup channel and DM the POAP bot **charles69**. All lower case.

**Algy:** That's it. I'm going to say it one more time. Don't miss it, though. I'm not going to repeat it. Dm the POAP bot **charles69**. All lower case.

**Nick:** Can we put the code inside the POAP bot? No claim?

**Algy:** You got to listen for the code.

**Troy:** Oh, is that the way, that's how we're setting up? All right, My bad.

**Algy:** And then you DM the POAP bot.

**Zach:** Yeah. Don't send it.

**Algy:** If you have your DMS turned off, you got to turn them on for a second. You hit the drop-down on your privacy settings, and you can turn on messages for a second.

**Zach:** I'm pretty sure it'll work.

**Algy:** Make sure you DM in the POAP bot.

**Algy:** **charles69** all lower case, I'll say it one more time. Since we confused everyone, what was Troy asking about? He's on some big brain stuff.

There you go. I was going to read what you were saying. Is anyone interested in the transcoding pool with XYZ integration alpha?

## XYZ + Graviton [[42:03]](https://youtu.be/GtuncSFIZEM?t=2523) üåå + üß≤

**Troy:** Yeah. Earlier in the week, last AMA, I said that there will be things that the private company we set up will be doing to kind of build utility into XYZ. And one of the things that we are doing that we can talk about now is that we've already started a working group with a live peer. 

So as you guys probably might know, there will be this streaming application that's being built that will connect to Minting Features inside of Universe in the marketplace. We haven't broken down how that's going to work yet. But it's coming. The thing that's cool about this is that the streaming is going to work via the Live Peer network. We're in a working group now where anyone who has a GPU will be able to add transcoding power to this orchestrator‚Äî which runs this streaming application. It will mine XYZ for you. And Trevor is on this call. This was originally his idea of how we could integrate XYZ closer into this whole streaming application, so we could pass it over to him if he wanted to break it down.

But the promise that we would do that is being fulfilled. And I just wanted to the point that out. That's a couple of things coming specifically to the token that we're working on.

**Tyler:** Nobody knows what Troy said because he's too much of a giga brain.

**Troy:** Yeah. Did I confuse everyone? If so, that's all right. There's going to be documentation. There'll be docs.

**Zach:** Yeah, there's going to be docs. There you go.

**Tyler:** Who said that? Tim. Oh, that was Zach that was Transmental. Sometimes I'm on calls and just don't want to doxx people.

**Troy:** Yeah, I know.

**Tyler:** It's hard.

**Troy:** Yeah.

**Tyler:** Oh, yeah. You are doxed, that's. Okay, I'm doxxed. My full government name is Tyler Ward.

**Ryan:** I think everyone at Universe is doxxed.

**Troy:** Yeah, pretty much for the most part. There might be a couple that no one knows.

**Algy:** No, I'm not anon.

**Tyler:** We all know who you are Aly.

**Algy:** Chuba wishes he was anon. ü•∑

**Ryan:** Yeah, I have respect for anon devs. 

**Algy:** No, I do too. It makes sense why people want to have privacy. Don't be a non and go on social media and tell everybody what to buy.

**Ryan:** Yeah, I mean, not a big fan of influencers doing shady things on Twitter.

**Community Member:** Hey, shout out to my Lobby Lobsters, Zach, Chad, and Universe. That's all I got to say.

**Algy:** Let's go.

**Community Member:** Listen, I just love my lobsters. It looks like some of the photographs I take, and that's it. I'm just OD Bullish on The Lobsters and what they stand for. And shout out Universe, shout out Zach and Chad.

**Tyler:** I can't promise this on the Lobsters, but it's just a side project with this Metaverse that I'm trying to build. It's a side project. We just need to figure out how hard it would be to 3D model those in it. But I like the Lobsters.

**Troy:** Like the Lobsters. We're going underwater. ü¶ûüåä

**Nick:** Underwater area and maybe even some James Bond-style shark tanks. I don't know if you have all seen that episode or movie of James Bond where they got the Sharks are Piranhas; they throw someone in it. We should put one of those in like a spaceship or something some DOXtor knows.

**Algy:** All right, the POAP code is **charles69**. ü§°

**Troy:** All lower case.

**Tyler:** Also, while we're on this Ben Franklin on here, I had a call with him on Sunday, and he asked some pretty good questions about our generalized go-to-market, and I want to just touch on that. Everyone contributed to that post and on the forum. Honestly, that was one of the more dope things I've seen on my attached projects. I think that was one of the most engaging. That was like YFI level engagement or Olympus level engagement for a forum post in terms of this community's ideas and gigabrains. I've been talking a lot with Ryan, Tim, Troy even before that, and we had a call with it like JPEG, XYZ. It's like the old Yam kids. They talked about XYZ; they saw it most closely aligned with Zora, a centralized company that uses many of our talking points to build an open protocol. Ultimately a centralized company just is never going to build as open protocol as what we're doing the protocol.

**Troy:** That's such a cool idea.

**Tyler:** Yeah. I don't think that's ever going to be able to be fully open though, because it's a centralized company that's building it.

But I do think some of their talking points are good. One thing that I thought was very good that they built was a finder's fee that allows people to plug into Universe. And if somebody went from their website and ended up doing it, they would be able to take a portion of that fee, which you can already do. So that opened up conversations where Billy talked to Joe Lubin about doing something like this with MetaMask. 

I haven't pushed that forward too far, but it starts to solidify just how powerful it is, what we've built. So Amazon scaled as a business because they had these massive referral networks, and those referral networks built Amazon's business. At one point, Amazon just shut the referral network down, which is why you can't ever trust a centralized company because they just thought they were so big. Why are we paying these people anymore? So if we create a finder's fee where curators and influencers, and people can plug into Universe, I think that in a similar way that Amazon scaled, we can scale Universe.

I even talked to [Andy](https://twitter.com/andy8052) from [Fractional](https://twitter.com/fractional_art). This would incentivize Leauge DAO to plug into our Marketplace, where League DAO could have its own Marketplace on its website that plugs into Universe and takes a portion of that. It also incentivizes places, and let's say that in this conversation that we're not even having yet with Metamask, they decide to integrate into Universe. That will incentivize League DAO, Fractional, Enter DAO, FLUF World. Everybody's going to want to essentially accumulate the XYZ tokens so that they can have a say in governance that we don't essentially mark that finders fee to zero. 

The curators will want that. If they built a business on top of Universe the way that people built businesses on top of Amazon, then naturally, they're going to want to have a say in the governance of how that finder's fee is governed. I think that's extremely powerful from a go-to-market perspective versus something like looks. That ultimately shows how many real volumes there are. If they're doing that much volume, you would have seen it cut into OpenSea, and OpenSea is hitting record highs in volume.

So we don't want just to launch a Ponzi and try to vampire attack OpenSea, and we waste a bunch of our tokens and governance so that we're not drumming up any real volume. So we've thought about how do we release something in the long term to go after the monopoly that is OpenSea. But to clarify OpenSeas moat, the monopoly lives in the fact that all of the listings are on OpenSea. And if you think about Laredo's Law and just the 8020 principles, the top 200 collections on OpenSea account for 95% of the volume. And so, I think that what we should be doing is incentivizing those collections to move over. And so, in the short run, if we do that by making it cheaper to make trades on Universe, yes, that will cut into the fees that the DAO essentially accumulates. But keep in mind, if you look at the Coin Market Cap from 2017 until now, the top 200 projects are entirely different. None of them are essentially the same. So I think our Auctions are revolutionary and will take care of the long tail where more groups will plug into us because we're marking those fees to zero at auctions on Primary.

During this call, I've had two different groups ask me if they can plug into our Auction Contracts for a use case that they want to utilize it for. So that's how you get all the new tokens that came in between 2017 and 2021. Those will naturally come to our platform to keep the analogy going because all the initial listings get posted up when you do the auction. When you're doing those initial listings, and it's all on the same platform, that takes care of the long tail. What do we need to do in the immediate term? Where do people want to move over all of their current listings? How do we attack the true mode that OpenSea has, which is those listings? Because of the mote of our liquidity layer, once we move all of that over and have the long tail. This is not like when Uniswap was vampire attacked by Sushi, where there was probably a 80-20 principal, 20% liquidity providers providing 80% of Uniswaps liquidity. All you have to do is convince the 20% people to move over, ERC 20 tokens which are fully fungible.

In this case, you have to talk 100,000 listings to move over. But the ones that are truly valuable say, hey, we're going to comp everybody that moves listings over. People are going to game it, and they're going to go in, and they're going to either mint shitty projects on Polygon. Then list everything to get a bunch of the fees. Or what they're going to do is mint all of their bad NFTs that went to zero because no one was interested in them. And they never have any chance of selling on our platform. So they find they get excess liquidity for those tokens. That's not ideal. So we should incentivize only the top 200 projects, and 5 of those top 200 projects are Fluf World, whom I think will move over. We should be doing some immediate-term things for the top 200 projects; we should incentivize them to move over by making sure that something is bought or sold on Universe. For those top 200 projects, the buyer and the seller essentially pay less fees and have more money in their pocket than if they had used OpenSea.

And we have to do that through listings and not listings themselves, but listings sold. Otherwise, they'll list everything on our platform for 1000 ETH, and it's never going to sell at that price. The second thing we need to focus on as a go-to-market, rational go-to-market, and not a Ponzi scheme is viewing ourselves as scaling like Amazon. We give some type of a finders fee so that more platforms are interested in plugging into Universe. Another thing that I think that we should do, which is a longer-term thing, is that we can build custom experiences for some of what we'll call the top 20 projects or the 20 things that are going to drive 90% of the volume on the platform. So something like an Enter DAO, we would have custom areas for something like a FLUF World. We can try to build custom things that make the experience better, such as fractional. We can build a custom experience for that, and then they can fork that experience and put it on their own interface. That's a bigger piece of work, and I don't think it's realistic that we can do that. Or even start thinking about that until 90 or even more 180 days after the marketplace launches because we're going to have much work to do, just fixing bugs and feature requests and things just from people using it in and of themselves.

And also need to Port those listings over because it doesn't matter if we have a better experience looking at them. Ultimately what they're going to do is they're going to use all of the tools that we custom-built. There are no listings; they're going to make the trades on OpenSea. So we're just driving value to OpenSea. 

So number one is making sure that we get listings ported over. Number two is making sure that we communicate with industry players and partners that this finders fee exists because OpenSea doesn't give one, and Zora can change it. So we have a competitive reason that they should want to integrate with us. The 3rd bucket is custom experiences for top projects, and I had a 4th one, but I'm 05:00 P.m., so I just want to communicate with everyone that I don't control this. We are going to have to vote on things, on how all this gets rolled out, but that's my vote in a well-thought-out way that we can, oh, sorry. The fourth thing was the auctions for Longdale. If we're attracting more talented artists to our platform because they can keep more of what they created, we're going to get better artists like people don't like to pay a fee if they don't have to.

So if we can execute on those four things, the Universe will put a dent into OpenSeas Monopoly. That is much more sustainable than if we launched some Ponzinomics bullshit. If I wanted to build a Ponzi scheme, I could build one, but that's not what we set out here to do. So I think that our go-to-market summer short term. Summer long term. I do not think it will be hard to incentivize the top 200 projects. Ryan can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems pretty easy. I think that we can incentivize the listings, and then that just comes down to other people telling many projects that they can do this and me. The top 20 experience again, can't do that out of the gate. And then the auctions are just a long tail thing. Something that launches on our platform will become a top 200 project and replace the other ones, and that's good. Hopefully, all the top 200 projects were launched on our platform via auctions. I mean, unrealistic. But if that happens, OpenSea no longer has any motion against us.

So we are thinking about this. üß†

**Ryan:** Yeah. I'm a big fan of the listing incentivization and order migration stuff. Tooling on that front is very important to make it easy for people to take over their existing listings and get them all set up on Universe. Of course, there are a little bit of transactions for approving collections, but if you have, say, ten FLUFs for sale on OpenSea, just one transaction to get all of them listed for sale. Not 10 different transactions or anything like that. It feels pretty smooth once you figure out how the migration works as a user.

**Troy:** Yeah. I think that once everyone wrapped their heads around this concept, it opened the floodgates of everyone being okay; yeah, this makes much sense. The big thing is everyone always wonders how we're going to get the marketplace to take over without doing stuff that puts us in a weird gray area with the law. I'm in full support of this idea, too. Once we all saw it and started thinking about it, it seemed like a no-brainer.

**Gbergphoto:** I've been here in Universal Marketplace, and I'm excited about it, and I intend to be one of those dope artists that do come over that Zach was speaking about. Yeah, I have some successful pieces on OpenSea, and I just know the people behind all of this are wizards, so, yeah, I'm excited for that. üßô

**Troy:** Nice.

**Nick:** Who's talking? So that we know, because it doesn't bring you to the top or anything. Awesome.

**Tyler:** Also, just so everyone knows a lot when I say that those four buckets were inspired by what was in that forum post. We just internalized it and put it into the short, medium and long term. I think they're all important. So I don't want to make it sound like we read all that and didn't listen and just doing our own thing. We wrapped everything that was said that was really good ideas into a workable format. 

So, first of all, thank you all for contributing because it helped us formulate a plan. And to Troy's point, it's not even about the legality of looks. It's that what they're doing is not real. It's not taking any volume away from OpenSea. So what's the point? It put us into sketchy regulatory waters, and we want to be building this for I don't know how long I'm going to live, but it's not effective. If it was very effective, we need to take it ultimately; it's still a DAO people could vote in.

And essentially, it's not our decision. The issue, though, is that it's not ideal. There are numerous red flags about it. So we, fortunately, were able to see through SOS and Looksrare‚Äî they only work optically. So let's come up with something that works properly. That's what we're going for here to build. Are we going to take over all of the OpenSeas volumes? Probably not in the first year, but we need to take enough of it. And yeah, Ponzinomics are probably not the way to do it as we've seen; we have something much more sustainable.

**Ryan:** We're more interested in effective incentives that create a healthy marketplace and not 2 minutes of marketing hype because we're doing volume that will not last long. That's my two cents.

**Zach:** I just need to clarify. Mark pointed out anybody that runs an auction; there are 0% fees, not just artists collect.

Yes, as long as you're the auctioneer, plug into it.

**Tyler:** I'm going to do an auction with the Genesis FLUFF and his Queen wife and one of my Snoop Burrows like a 3 piece. And I'll just auction it, and everyone can bid what they want on it. That's the use case of the auctions. I can auction out my own collection. I was never going to sell the Genesis FLUF, but ultimately I care enough about Universe, and I want the whole Fluffy Ecosystem to pay attention. So, yeah, I'm going to do that.

**Ryan:** I think I plan to create the 25th shirtless Charles through scrambling and then auction him off as a one of one. That should be fun.

**Tyler:** I'm also working on auctions, which Transmental (Zach) talked about today. So we'll figure that out.

**Algy:** I feel like I should know this. Are you guys saying that when I auction-like, let's say, an NFT that I own that I didn't make, or that I just already owned that has zero fees as well?

**Ryan:** Yes.

**Tyler:** You're not the artist or anything like that.

**Algy:** So it's not just on primary sale.

**Ryan:** Anyone can sell whatever they want without fees on the auctions. But you do have to pay your collection royalties and whatever other royalties tied into that NFT. So it doesn't get around any of these royalties you're paying otherwise. But it doesn't have this 2.5% OpenSea fee or whatever marketplace fee Universe is charging. It does have the ability to be configured by the DAO, though. So in the future, if the DAO does decide to turn on fees for auctions, it could opt for a fee and maybe a fee lower than the Universe Marketplace, for example, to kind of stay true to that vision.

**Algy:** What do you guys think about possibly eventually, like for maybe a V2 making a function where we made it possible for people to trade NFTs directly?

**Tyler:** I don't think there's any reason we shouldn't do that because I think that will at least reduce some of the wash tradings. Are you talking about having an escrow that transfers when both sides are met?

**Algy:** Yes. I don't know how exactly it would be set up.

**Troy:** You can set it up where both sides need to agree. And once both sides agreed, it would just activate the contract. So it would be like an escrow.

**Algy:** Exactly.

**Troy:** The last person that hit yes would pay the transaction fee for the swap.

**Ryan:** So our contracts do support NFT swaps on the marketplace. I think the question is how you create a good P2P user experience around NFT trading. I know a few others have tried their hand at it. I haven't seen anything that I like yet, and I think it is revolutionary, but I think innovation on that front would be awesome.

**Zach:** I think it would be dope if you could if you went to somebody's page and they had a sick Escrow, and you had this Marijuana that you thought was on the same level, rarity wise, you could click the little three dots and then submit NFT for trade, and if they accept it, then the transaction goes through.

**Tyler:** But that seems like the easiest shit in the world. I don't know how nobody's built that properly. Maybe they're trying to build it where you're swapping, and they're trying to figure out how much it's worth. But Troy is right. You just have a vault that they go to. It custom creates a vault, and then both sides have to hit approve, and then it swaps it. If one side is declined, then it just goes back. They send it back to each other's wallets.

**Ryan:** You just do it through bids. In the same way, you can make an offer on any NFT. Instead of making an offer in WETH, you can make an offer with another NFT. And if they accept that.

**Troy:** Yeah, exactly.

**Ryan:** If the swap doesn't happen, there is no need for any more gas. It's just one signature and one transaction, and that's it.

**Nick:** So, Ryan, are you saying that it is going to be in the marketplace?

**Tyler:** It's the same thing.

**Ryan:** We don't have support for that in the marketplace.

**Algy:** Front end side, probably for V2.

**Ryan:** The back-End and front-end support. Yeah. But our contracts do support that.

**Tyler:** Okay, cool. Well, yeah, it's not going to be there at launch, everybody. But you can expect it, probably.

**Algy:** Another thing that I also have, I think I've talked to you guys about being interested in, is something that OpenSea used to do is allow people to make private sales with no fee. 

They took it away; when they took it away, what ended up happening was that people started using these alternate sites to trade on. 

In my opinion, it is best to allow people to make private sales on our website for no fees. What ended up happening to OpenSea is they shut down many Bored Apes and expensive NFTs that had kept trading through private sales‚Äî they lost the power to turn them off with private sales. 

Let's say for us as a DAO, it would generate more revenue to the DAO than forcing people to go on another website and potentially having to deal with them getting scammed. I don't know. I've said that, in my opinion, just from my experience, I think OpenSea backfired on them a lot because a lot less people are able to, not a lot less people, but a lot of NFTs have gotten turned off.

That would have generated the protocol more money, and it just created problems for people. So, yeah, in my opinion, we also should have a situation where people can make private sales for zero fees because, I mean, private sales don't happen that often. And if they are going to happen, they're going to happen. There's no way around it. So it might as well just make a safe experience for people to get that done so that we don't have to deal with somebody stealing their NFT.

**Troy:** I agree. I agree 100% that we should have stuff like that, I mean, that just plays into our whole ethos. We don't take fees on the auctions. That just makes total sense.

**Algy:** Yeah. Nice. I'm glad we are on the same page on that.

**Ryan:** The other interesting part of this is the royalty side that the royalties can be used in a way where you can create custom curated front-ends, hook them into the Universe Marketplace, take a fee for powering this curated front-end. Then this goes to that network effect or as a referral system almost, but with different Marketplaces that have their own niches potentially powered by Universe.

**Tyler:** All right, this is some serious alpha right here.

**Ryan:** But that would require integration, partners, and people building out curated marketplaces. Of course.

**Tyler:** Yeah, but that's whom we're talking with. We're talking with the JPEG guys. We're talking with Fractional; we're talking with Enter DAO. They are thinking of doing it. They help build Universe.

**Ryan:** They can all hook in. They can put up their fee, whatever they want to charge on their funds, and the DAO gets their 1.5% or whatever DAO fee ends up being voted on.

**Ryan:** My friends endearingly called the Polymorphs, Chuba Punks, and I always feel good when they say that. Maybe a year ago, not at first, but now they're always texting me about the Chuba Punks. And I'm like, I love you guys. üíô

**Algy:** You didn't get one.

**Tyler:** What are Cuba Punks? 

**Ryan:** No, I'm saying my friends call the Polymorphs‚Äî Chuba Punks.

**Algy:** That is what they are.

**Ryan:** I don't know about that...

**Tyler:** Punks are like trademarked for NFT; they can't do that, can they?

**Algy:** No, they can trademark the word Crypto Punk, but they can't trademark the word punk.

**Ryan:** Interesting. ü§î

**Tyler:** I don't know. They might be able to.

**Algy:** Do you think so? If it's an NFT, they might be able to, but not for general use.

**Tyler:** I don't know, but I think we can name it a Chuba Punk.

**Algy:** Polymorph. Let's name it a Polymorph. This is how we came up with the name Polymorph.

**Ryan:** They really should be‚Äî George Punks, but that's okay.

**Algy:** George Punks. Yeah. You guys don't even get to talk to George. Well, next time, we'll make George speak on the AMA.

**Ryan:** I am going to wake him up at like 03:00 A.m. And have him talk about the morphs.

**Algy:** He'll get excited, though. Even at 03:00 A.m.

**Ryan:** He won't be able to fall back to sleep after that. We won't do that to George. No, of course not.

**Algy:** If you want to talk to George, you can join the Enter DAO AMAs.

**Ryan:** So people are commenting on the private sales and whether it makes sense to offer no-fee private sales. You can argue that the services of the marketplace match buyers and sellers. So if you already have a buyer and seller, the DAO can, I guess, for free offer the ability to trust us to make that exchange. But there is an argument that should only take fees for matches, that it helps facilitate where you didn't know the buyer or seller before agreeing. I can see both arguments, but I also don't think that having felt private listings takes a big hit out of the overall fees the DAO would be earning.

**Algy:** It just prevents people from getting scammed is the bigger thing. Of course, it would help the DAO, I guess, to take the fee. 

You have to understand that if we have to turn off NFTs, that is going to lose us more money than taking the fee on these private sales. Most people don't do private sales. I've collected over 200 NFTs, and I join the Discord every time I buy a new NFT and participate. So I'm trying to consolidate nowadays into ones I believe in. But there already are places to do feeless trading, and there's no community where everyone's like, let's avoid the fee. Everybody trades through the Discord. That just doesn't happen. Most people are lazy, and I'm trying to snipe the best deal. Also, many people list on the floor. People aren't very confident is another thing. They don't want to go into the Discord and say let's create a private sale.

Because they don't even talk, they don't even say hey in the Discord; they just look for the announcements. 

So that isn't something that I think is a good argument because that's not what will happen. There's not going to be a revolution where every person is only going to make private sales. Even if that did happen, I would be so impressed that I would not care that much anyway. That would just be impressive. 

**Ryan:** There was another argument, Algy; you made for this before. I'm trying to remember exactly how you made it. I guess if I remember.

**Algy:** I'll just offer the thing is I would want you to do more because when you trade your NFT, all you're doing is trading ETH for the NFT, right? That's better. The person can still sell the NFT at the same price if they change their mind the next day, and you could buy another NFT with that ETH that you just got. And overall, neither of you got scammed. So overall, the ecosystem is benefiting from that. When you think about it, it's better than you have to risk it on this other website. We had to turn off your NFT, and then one of the parties not being able to continue moving forward with their NFT experience because they got scammed.

**Ryan:** The amount of money that we could lose if we turn off these NFTs can be much greater than the fees collected on the private sales because of the number of users getting scammed on these private listings.

**Algy:** Overall, it will allow a better continuing flow, not having as many issues with people. It was greedy when OpenSea turned off. They had it on at the beginning, and it was because it made sense. They turned it off because they got greedy, in my opinion. I mean, how else could you argue? When they did that, it messed up what they had going because now they are constantly dealing with scams, and they don't want to admit they were wrong, so they don't turn it back on. 

**Ryan:** Somebody goes, maybe one day we might contact message an NFT holder‚Äî prior to the exchange. 

I used to like Mint Polygon NFT to try to reach people if there was no other way of accessing a communication channel with them. I know there's an ethmail now and a few other things, but I think that's still the best way to contact NFT holders. Just make them a polygon NFT and send it over to them.

**Troy:** Are you using ethmail?

**Ryan:** No, not that I'm aware of. I have one email in there that somebody sent me. I have no idea why they sent me an email or how they found my address.

**Troy:** We looked into using that as a way to give out email accounts. People could have Barnbridge email accounts and stuff. We always thought that would be a cool way to decentralize DAO communications. But that was almost over a year ago. I was just curious if someone had actually or if people had caught on to if that was like a usable system.

**Ryan:** No, there's a new system that came out that doesn't have ENS support that and you definitely can't do subdomain support. Maybe they could look at it. I don't know what their tech looks like or how upgradable their contracts are. I know ENS is upgradable. So you don't own your ENS domains like this could always be pulled in a contract upgrade or something. So I don't know how to like whether it's the same situation.

**Troy:** Yeah. I don't know‚Äî it's kind of an interesting concept, you could create with the Universe front-end. You could create a mailing system through it. But you said there are probably some problems there.

**Tyler:** Hey everybody, I got to hop because I need to get dinner before I get other calls this evening. I love all of you. üíö

**Troy:** I'm going to hop too! 

Yeah, we love you guys. üíö

**Algy:** Talk to you guys later.

**Troy:** 69Charles all lower case

**Ryan:** Charles70 is the code‚Äî talk to you all soon.

**Tyler:** I thought it was Chuba Punk? ü§î

**Troy:** Damn it. I don't remember.

**Tyler:** I forgot, but yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Chuba Punk.

**Troy:** Chuba Punk. Yeah, that sounds right.

**Algy:** You could try Goblin-town, but it might not work.

**Troy:** Later.

**Tyler:** Bye everyone! 

**Ryan:** Peace. ‚úåÔ∏è

**Algy:** All right, bye guys. We're all hoping. üëãüê∞
