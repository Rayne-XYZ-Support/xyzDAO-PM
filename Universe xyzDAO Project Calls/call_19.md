## Intro

**Mark:** Hey, everyone. Welcome to Project call number 19. 

It is the Christmas season, so as you may know, things are getting a little crazy and hectic, but we'd like to reassure you guys that we're all going to be hustling until pretty much Christmas Day. üéÅüéÑ

We will be taking a break a little bit after Christmas and the New Year, because that's the holiday season. We have employees from all over the world, and the Christmas holiday days don't exactly line up with America. So, we'll all be kind of in and out around that time. But, we will still be heads down building just because we have deadlines approaching, and we want to get a lot of these products out by Q1, 2022. But we're excited about everything still. Christmas is coming up, so we have a little bit of a break. We want to reassure you that we're still hustling away at this and building as fast as possible because our main priority is getting out the marketplace, auctions and minting. I will go ahead and hand it over to Ryan for some minting and marketplace updates.


## Minting & Marketplace [[]]()

**Ryan:** Yes, we're working on the minting and marketplace as we have been. It's going to be coming out at some point in Q1, 2021 or 2022. The exciting part is that we're working on some optimism contracts right now to start to roll out the products on both Ethereum main. Net and on optimism over time. And this is going to include all of the products like Minting, Marketplace and Auctions. But it will be rolled out over time, just like on the Ethereum mainnet. I can't dive into any of the features, but I can say that the minting flow that we pulled out is being reworked and is looking incredible. So I think we're all excited about that. I think I can hand it over to Iliya to talk a little bit about the auctions.

## Auctions [[]]()

**Iliya:** Thanks, Ryan. We have been working on the auctions for quite a while, and I'm almost anxious to see everything fit into place. We're talking about auctions on Ethereum mainnet, of course. Currently, we wrapping up the happy parts. What I mean by that; Those successful cases when you can do an auction, finalize it, claim your NFTs if you want, and so on. We'll be starting internal testing soon, we will provide updates on following calls.

**Mark:** I know we have a testing team in the community. I want to let you guys know we may not open that up to you guys right away just because we usually do a lot of testing internally first to get away like to get some of the obvious problems fixed. It hasn't been decided if we will open up that beta testing to the OGS, but as of right now, we are not. But if anything changes. 

I will be in touch with the OGS and get them beta testing access. They did a great job last time helping us with the minting. The team's plan is not to give that out right away. 

I want to give some updates, too, on yield farming opportunities. 

## Yield Farming üöúüåæ [[]]()

I've been going over this on the project calls just so people are aware of what they can do with the XYZ token if they don't want to stake it in the [Universe DAO](https://dao.universe.xyz/governance/overview), which is what we recommend so that you can participate in governance if you're new to that.

This is an excellent way for NFT people to learn about governance and DeFi governance‚Äî why we have it. But also, there is yield farming opportunities with the League DAO token and the Enter DAO token. And very soon, I believe that we will be farming Asto token, which is the altered state machine token. I believe that the Fluffles are getting something that we will farm with. But, not entirely sure about that. I have heard some things that the XYZ community may have an opportunity elsewhere.

**Tyler:** We heard whispers that something was coming.

**Mark:** For the [Flufs](https://www.fluf.world/). Yes. üêá

Not to mention all the fun games and things that we have been creating to go along with the Flufs and the Polymorphs. So, a lot to come. A ton is coming in January and February. We want to thank everyone for sticking with us and holding their Polymorphs, and waiting for us to get these games ready. I promise you will not be upset when you see all the stuff we release for Polymorphs. I'm going to go ahead and hand it over to Tyler. Tyler wants to give a yearly recap. This has been a pretty incredible year for us. We've learned a lot as a team as a community. I like to call this the year of NFTs. I'll let Tyler take it over and give us our yearly recap.


## Yearly Recap ‚Äî Year of NFTs: [Lord of the Ty's](https://twitter.com/LordTylerWard) üë®‚Äçüè´üñº [[]]()

**Tyler:** I would say that I've heard a couple of people, or at least on Twitter, talk about the time and speed to ship. 

While we hear that, a lot is dropping in January. I think people will understand at that point what we've been building, it was an extremely ambitious undertaking from the get-go. If everybody remembers how this started and the exciting times and the NonFungible Pepe Discord,(RIP FALLEN AMPHIBIAN) that was honestly one of the most fun NFT drops in a very long time.

I think that even though we had to deal with some of the issues that resulted from that, I still feel that it paved the way for a lot of other NFTs. I mean, to think that we were a small part of why NFTs popped off with the type of media that came. Some of the attention brought to NFTs was through that. And I think that it attracted a lot of other builders to the ecosystem and helped reinvigorate some of the NFT community's excitement or some of the DeFi communities' excitement around NFTs. 

So, I believe that was when we merged those two industry groups and communities. That's the main piece; I like to think that we were a small piece when we decided that we had an awesome community with excellent builders attached to it, even in traditional capital, who also were getting excited about NFTs at the time. We started to think through some of the things that were headaches. Through that process, what were essentially some of the things that we saw that needed to get fixed. 

What ended up happening was this‚Äî while we decided that we needed to fix those things, *the industry grew drastically*. So, we ended up dropping Polymorphs. 

That I think even to this day was one of the most technologically advanced NFTs ever. And even George from Lime Chain coming in and contributing as an advisor was like, so ? and awesome for us. We started building on the Polymorphs. And then the Polymorphs [Aaron](https://twitter.com/aaronmcdnz) from [Fluf World](https://twitter.com/flufworld) told me Sunday, on a call, that a lot of the technology that we wrote and created for Polymorphs was what inspired Flufs.

Fast forward even from there. Then the advisors who worked on the Polymorph spun out the Enter DAO ecosystem because George wasn't ever an employee of Universe. Lots of what they're building into Enter DAO and the jobs they're doing will integrate with a lot of the things that we're building on the Universe side. Suppose you can think of these metaportals where you can walk up to something and purchase them or even finance them through almost a mortgage-type concept.

All of that is this overarching merger between marketplaces that are decentralized minting. That is, decentralized auctions that are decentralized metaverses, tying back to concepts around DeFi. We were some of the builders that came out of that movement. So, we ended up launching minting. It's currently not on the interface because we decided we wanted to add a bunch of functionality to it from some of the celebrities and artists we work with, who are waiting to work with us. 

*Auctions are coming soon. The marketplace is coming soon.* üôè

As a heads up, on the component where I said, not only did we grow quite substantially from being kind of a pixelated frog project to being a dynamic group that was building decentralized technology and guts and middleware into the NFT industry. The industry grew a lot of the back ends that we were creating and the infrastructure we were creating when we started this. 

I mean, NFTs were doing like $10 million in monthly volume. Well, that grew to billions. It's the same way that the internet scaled. The same way that AWS scaled to support Amazon is the only reason that AWS exists. That's what we've had to do while building this product. It happened on the back end because we saw everyone complain about not just OpenSea, but service went down. We knew that when we released this, it had to work. And I'm not saying it's never going to go down. I'm not saying we got it perfect. Butm we put ourselves in a position from an architecture perspective that we're going to be able to scale efficiently, quickly and fix things that do break when they break.

We're excited about the things coming in, Q1 and Q2. I mean, that's my Ted Talk. (Tyler Talk üòâ)


That's what happened over the past year. And I think people will realize when we drop it just how much we've been building. We haven't been lazy or distracted, we've been busting our butts, and it's all going to come to light and be open source and share with the industry. 

**Mark:** I would add that polymorphs were something that we had a lot of fun doing. 

We have created multiple more NFT drops. But, after we dropped the Polymorph, as Tyler has said, we did shift our focus. When we get our auctions, minting and other products out, we have a finished core drop ready to go. We have other NFT drops we've been working on. 

From the outside looking in, Tyler mentions it does look like we can be distracted sometimes, but when you guys do see the whole realm of what we have been creating, and you realize that 60% to 70% of the things that we built this year didn't actually get released yet. Anyone who was saying that Universe is not working, will have to look back and eat their words because there's going to be‚Äî I can't even believe how much they built this year.

**Tyler:** The drops, everything, a lot is coming. We just had to prioritize the marketplace.

**Mark:** Not to mention value and not to mention what Tyler says. The people who want to work with us, the protocols who wish to work with us, the teams who want to work with us, the list is endless, and we're ready. We just got to get these things. We just got to get these products out so everyone can use them and start doing all this stuff we've been saying we've wanted to do for so long. I think we've covered everything.

**Troy:** I think one thing, though, that we could talk about or not talk about but say is be on the lookout for a bunch of really cool, community-building initiatives that involve the Metaverse.

**Mark:** That's one thing I think that's a good point to bring up. I personally know a few people building some cool stuff for the Metaverse and building cool games for Polymorphs and Flufs. They're part of Universe but not directly paid to work at Universe. Teams who are building things. I was told that I'm not allowed to reveal anything, but some of these games that I have seen getting built are amazing, and George, you are a God, my friend. You are a God.

If you think the games we're creating are cool, wait until you see the other games our friends are creating because those games are going crazy. We can't talk about those games. Those games are going to break the internet and also Nikita's game. You all are not ready for Nikita's game. All right, let me do one more thing. 

Let's check discord and see if anyone has community questions. All right, I don't see any project call questions.

Okay. No project call questions. So I think that's all everyone. Thank you for tuning in hit like, subscribe, and all this stuff. 

**Troy:** I'll see you in Miami.

**Mark:** Enjoy your Christmas with your mom's. Buy her something nice with all your NFT money you made this year. Yeah, and Troy will see you guys in Miami. Whatever that means. ü§î

**Troy:** Ryan knows.üòè

**Ryan:** Delete, no alpha leaks. üôÖ‚ê°

**Troy:** Anyway. Have a nice holiday, everyone. ‚úåÔ∏èüéÑ

**Iliya:** See you, everyone. Happy holidays. üéÖüíö
