## Intro

**Mark:** Hey, everyone. Welcome to project call number 18. 

Sorry about last week. I messed up the project call numbers. The previous project call is 17, not 16. 

So we're getting into our 18th call now. It seems like I've been doing this forever now, but I'm excited that we're getting a lot closer to launching all of our products. So I wanted to go over some agenda pieces. I will go over minting, the marketplace and auctions. 


## Minting 🎨 [[00:34]](https://youtu.be/z8NQYiieuvQ?t=34)

**Mark:** As some of you may know, we had to pull down the minting for our own reasons. We had some internal discussions, and what we released wasn't exactly what we wanted. We're going to recalibrate it and then launch it along with all the other products that we have planned for the end of this month or early quarter one— 2022. Our goal for all of these product releases is roughly around Christmas time. As everyone knows, Christmas is like a hard deadline to stick by. People have the holidays, and things gets crazy. We are putting a dynamic release date out there. It's not Christmas, but it's going to be kind of Christmas time.

We want everyone to be aware. We are pushing for that, but it's just our best hopes at this point. We're confident we're going to be able to do it, but we don't want anyone to be upset if there's no Universe marketplace on Christmas morning. But, Q1 2022 early, you can for sure know we're going to have all that released for everyone to be using. Minting should only be down for a month. And if anyone minted anything on the Universe Contract, I may end up reaching out to you. I think there are only, like, 2 or 3 people that minted anything. So, I'll end up reaching out to you guys and talking to you all, but I will move off the minting.

The significant updates were taking it down. Minting will be back up. Hopefully, within the month or at the end of the month or early January. 


Alright, marketplace updates. 

## Marketplace 🖼 [[02:40]](https://youtu.be/z8NQYiieuvQ?t=160)

**Mark:** Recently, I think many people have seen some alpha on [Twitter about an Optimism marketplace](https://twitter.com/universe_xyz/status/1485092144641716224). So to give a little bit of feedback about that. So Kain of [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) is a contributor and one of the original people who helped Tyler get some people together for Universe XYZ.

He was one of the original 30 people who helped with the NFTs. So [Kain](https://twitter.com/kaiynne) has been around for a while. And as some people know, at [Synthetix](https://twitter.com/synthetix_io), they're helping facilitate all the production of [Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC). 

As some people may know, last week, we got whitelisted to deploy contracts on Optimism. That's exciting. That means we're going to be the only at the time And have trhe chance to be the only marketplace on Optimism. So you're going to be able to mint NFTs, buy, sell, trade, auction. All of our tools are going to be on Optimism. Part of the reason we'll be able to do this is because we got whitelisted, and the team is working with us. We want to get something out quick for them, and the EVM equivalence makes that easier for us to do. So, shout out to [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). They're doing some badass stuff over there. If you guys want to look into EVM equivalents and what that means, I can drop an article on YouTube so people can read into that. It's cool. It makes it so that you can deploy any Ethereum based contract on Optimism.

I believe it takes a little bit of back-end reworking, but for the most part, it's fairly easy to deploy already written contracts that work on Ethereum directly to Optimism. If anyone has experienced coding, they know it's not as easy to do that with things like Polygon and other layer twos. And messing around with other blockchains gets complex.(Cross chain) So, we're super excited about that. That's been a big thing on Twitter. 

Okay, next is Auctions. 

## Auctions 🧑‍⚖️ 🖼 [[05:13]](https://youtu.be/z8NQYiieuvQ?t=313)

**Mark:** Auction is something we've been working on for a while. We've been doing a few rounds of audits because it is a pretty complicated contract and has needed about three rounds of audits. But luckily, we have received our last round of audits, and it seems like everything is looking excellent on that. Not exactly sure when we're going to have all that connected, it looks like Auctions will be ready to go with all the other products to Q1 2022— if there are no hiccups or hold-ups on that. 

## Yield Farming 🚜🌾 [[05:59]](https://youtu.be/z8NQYiieuvQ?t=359)

**Mark:** Okay, next, I want to go over. I've been talking about this on the last few project calls, but there's are a few yield farming opportunities if people are unaware, [League DAO](https://dao.leaguedao.com/yield-farming), [Enter DAO](https://dao.enterdao.xyz/yield-farming). You can go to their yield farming pages and stake XYZ. You can stake and yield farm. Also, you have the opportunity for DAO staking on the Universe DAO and participating in Universe Governance. 


Speaking of Governance, on the last project call, we've mentioned a multi-version proposal. 

Troy, did we get that proposal out and published? I know we brought it up on the last project call, and maybe we should bring it up again.


## Proposal [PID:4]() 🗳 [[06:53]](https://youtu.be/z8NQYiieuvQ?t=413)

**Troy:** So the proposal is in the signal or whatever we call it, and there have been some comments around it. It's been relatively positive. So I will be putting in a DAO vote around that soon, but I just haven't had time. Then there will be a vote for paying Fleek for the year, so be on the lookout for that.

**Mark:** Okay, nice. Two proposals, one for Multiverse and one for Fleek. So check that out. One's in signal, and we will keep you guys updated on all of that. 


So really, we have one more update, and it's around the Polymorphs. 


## Polymorphic Update 🦹 [[07:32]](https://youtu.be/z8NQYiieuvQ?t=452)

I want to give some information about the world of Polymorphs. We have all been very busy building. And I think some of the community has seen us with our heads down building. We haven't been talking about or doing too much publicly about the Polymorphs. 

But, I want to reassure everyone that we haven't forgotten about you guys. We've reverted back to what we initially said, what we were going to do, which is to build the products we want. We had fun this year. We have been building and have had our heads down. We will stick to our guns and get the products that we're in the home stretch for on this. We have one more Polymorph contract under audit right now, basically our V2 audit. It's supposed to be back, but it's taking a little bit longer than anticipated.

But once that's finished, we will be able to have Polymorph Gaming. We're going to have feeless scrambling and potentially a lot more coming into the future. There's one thing I do want to go over with people because I think there is confusion about what exactly people are getting in the burn-to-mint. 

After all, there have been a few pictures cycling around on Twitter of Clown Charles. And yesterday or the day before, I tweeted like a 3D rendering of Gold Tooth, and many people were curious to know what that was. So I'm just going to take a step back and forget about Gold Tooth. We'll go back to the 2D 3D-looking Clown Charles that people have been posting. We will allow everyone with a Polymorph to burn their original Polymorph and get a V2 Polymorph. 

The way that this works;

> We all have 2D ones right now. 

We don't want anyone to be forced themselves to use a 3D. You're going to be able to choose if you burn to get a V2 which is two dimensional.

*It would be like taking your Polymorph and burning it for the same thing that you have— **but, getting a V2.**

A V2 will allow you to plug and play into all the Polygon stuff that we have built. The battle game and anything that we have in the future will work with these V2 Polymorphs. We have to do it this way. 

It's just going to create more utility and use cases for the Polymorphs. We're just going to be able to put them in more games. We're going to be able to do more fun stuff with them. And speaking of games, I know we've talked about this before, but we are working on two games. Lime Chain is working on Morph Land. I know George hasn't allowed anyone to get too much insight on that, but I've seen it, and it looks amazing. I have also seen other things that Lime Chain is working on for Enter DAO and some of their games. I am completely blown away by the games. I don't think that any Crypto NFT collection has games that I see them building.

Maybe lluvium compares, but it's good what I'm seeing. 

Shoutouts to [Lime Chain](https://limechain.tech/). 🪖🛠

I don't think Lime Chain gets enough credit, but they're always building just highly cool stuff.💯💻

 It's like they were made for this. It was like they've been waiting to turn on the brain juice for all the NFT fun stuff. We've built internally, built a battle game. It's kind of like a roll of the dice battle game based off your character's attributes, and that one's going to be a ton of fun. You're going to be able to gamble ETH, and that's going to go live after the marketplace. 
 
As I said, we're focusing on what we meant to build. NFTs are fun, but we want to get out what we said we were going to develop at the end of the day. Instead of building all this cool utility for the Polymorphs first, we're doing it. I want everyone to know we have our priorities, and we want to stick to our guns. 

One other thing I want to mention is that there's a protocol out called Zoo Dao. 

## [ZooDAO](https://twitter.com/ZooDAO) 🦍🖼 [[12:54]](https://youtu.be/z8NQYiieuvQ?t=774)
 
They've been tweeting a lot about all sorts of NFT projects because they built a game that allows you to battle NFTs against each other.

Right now, you can take Polymorphs and battle them in the Zoo DAO game. I'm not entirely sure how the game works. I'm not quite sure if the contracts are all audited. But I'm supposed to hop on a call with Zoo DAO soon. I'm going to figure out exactly what the whole deal is, what their mission is. I'm super interested. I love the idea of gaming that allows utility of any NFT. Whenever projects suggest they can plug this one in, and anyone can play. I think that's a cool idea for gaming and a part of the next step. 

But check out [Zoo DAO](https://zoodao.com/). 

**They are not affiliated with us**. I don't know those guys, but it looks cool what they're doing, and it seems like everyone else is super excited about that. 

Hopefully, Ryan and I can hop on a call with these guys soon and get to the bottom of what they want to do and see how the Universe and Polymorphs can align. We will see what kind of unique features we can build with them.

Alright, that's the V2 Polymorphs. 

Now, the 3D Polymorph that I tweeted the other day, I wanted to give everyone a [little alpha tweet](https://twitter.com/markwardbro/status/1453757621022994440). 

We have not told anyone about the things we've been working on. We have been working on a lot for Polymorphs. One thing that we are working on is Metaverse capability. 3D voxel files, you can use for so many things. You can use them for video games, TV shows, animations and videos. Once you create those 3D images and 3D files, it gives us a lot of versatility— more options. They're not the easiest or quickest things to make. While those photos I tweeted the other day are alpha leaks, will happen. We're leaning towards, perhaps, never making an NFT of those 3D things. We want to try and bring utility for stuff like [Sandbox](https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame), [Decentraland](https://twitter.com/decentraland). Then we can see what other cool things we can do with those files. As the technology advances and those files become more versatile, I believe we'll have interesting innovations.

Ryan has already been playing around and experimenting with the files. He's built a Polymorph worship statue in [Cryptovoxels](https://twitter.com/cryptovoxels), I don't know where it is, but if you want to go worship Vitalik, the alien Polymorph. Ryan may be able to drop a link to you guys so that you could do that. 

But yeah, guys, we have a ton we're working on. We have to stick to our guns and priorities and get out these products. Or we're never going to release everything we want to. 

At this rate, we must stick to our guns and not get distracted. Because everyone in this industry knows it's easy to get distracted with all the fun stuff going on. 

**Tyler:** I think we have a lot of code.

**Mark:** What's that, Tyler?

**Tyler:** We're about to drop a lot of code. So, it's coming.

**Mark:** Yeah, like **150,000 lines**, something ridiculous. 

Okay, so I'm going to check one last thing, and then we can wrap up this call. I'm going to go into the Discord, and let's check out community questions. Lately, there hasn't been too many community questions.

There are no community questions. 

Okay, guys? Well, does anyone want to say anything? 

No? Okay well, today was me telling you everything. You all get to enjoy all these beautiful people. All right. Thank you. 

Everyone hit like, subscribe, all the stuff, retweet, share. 

I love you all. Bye. 👋❤️
