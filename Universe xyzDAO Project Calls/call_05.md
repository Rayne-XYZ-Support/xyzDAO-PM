## Intro [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/glRSBWgwQ34)

**Mark:** Hello, everyone!

Welcome to project call five for Universe and xyzDAO! 


## Yield Farming (need to know) [[00:07]](https://youtu.be/glRSBWgwQ34?t=7)üßë‚Äçüåæüöú

We're really excited. We've finally launched the token. 

### Epochs (End Sunday/Monday)

Epoch 1 has now ended for yield farming, and everyone can claim their rewards for the first epoch. There are 19 weeks left on those farms. So, everyone, enjoy those harvests!

### Sushi LP and LP Token (Farm launched Monday)

**Mark:** Next off‚Äì the Sushi LPs are live. 

You can now take your XYZ tokens and either provide liquidity on Sushiswap.

 Or 

You can go ahead and stake your XYZ in the DAO.

There are about 50 million tokens needed to activate the DAO and reach the proposal threshold. (3.4 currently staked)

From there, we can submit proposals and use the functions of the DAO. Then there is the Sushi LP that you can provide liquidity too. After supplying liquidity, you receive a pool token (proportional to your share of the pool), and you can stake that in a yield farm and earn XYZ rewards. 

So, there are a few things you can use XYZ token for right now‚Äì which is pretty cool. 

### 150m in TVL üéâü•Çüéä

**Mark:** We want to thank everyone. We're honoured that we've reached 150 million in TVL within the first week. I personally was not expecting such a high number. Some of the team members might have.

I want to personally say, along with the rest of the team‚Äì Thanks for sticking with us the last four months and really blowing us away. We're happy to see that, and everyone is still sticking with us. 

Thank you to all the communities, Chainlink, Sushiswap, Compound, Aave, Illuvium and SNX too! You are all amazing! We could not have done it without you all. 

I'm going to talk about‚Äì I slightly took Dragos thunder. I was going to get him to explain this.     

Dragos, is there anything else we should mention about the yield farms that everyone should know?

**Dragos:** Not much. You basically covered it all. 

So, successful end of epoch one, we started epoch two as you touched base on. The LP pool is active now. Sushiswap can be used for that. 

We did have one hiccup when we went into epoch number two from epoch one. We solved that, so we can clap for everyone on the response time. 

The token pools are 20 epochs. The LP pool is 100 epochs, and the activation threshold for the DAO is 50 million XYZ tokens. So, we can keep on moving. 

**Mark:** Thanks, Dragos!

## Airdrops & Farm Claims [[03:31]](https://youtu.be/glRSBWgwQ34?t=211) üöÅüéÅ & üßë‚Äçüåæüåæ

**Mark:** I want to mention one more thing, and that will be about how to claim all of this. I'll cover both the airdrop claim and the yield farm. 

### How to Claim 

**Mark:**  If you are on the yield farming page for the DAO, you are going to see your current rewards in the top left corner of the DAO. And in the top right corner of that same page, you'll see a box that says 'airdrop rewards.'

So, basically, there will be a claim button next to both of those, and you can claim whenever. 

### How it works

**Mark:** With the yield farms, you don't have to claim every week. Your rewards will not disappear if you don't claim them. Just so everyone knows, it's not time-sensitive, and you won't lose the tokens that have accrued.   

The airdrop is slightly different‚Äì I know we've touched on this‚Äì I want to reiterate.

Wait, let's take a step back. 

### Delay (few weeks)

**Mark:** We are pushing the airdrop back by a few weeks. I'm not exactly sure what our reasoning was‚Äì but we are delaying it by about four weeks. The claim theory will still be around 20 weeks. 

Those airdrops will sit for 20 weeks, and if you withdraw early, there will be some sort of penalty that gets rolled over to the others still in the pool. 

So, as I said, there are a few things you can do with XYZ tokens. You can stake them in the DAO or provide liquidity. It's up to you and what you would like to do with your tokens and your airdrop. 

You can choose to wait and earn some tokens from people who leave early. 

Or 

You can take those XYZ tokens and figure out something else to do with them in the XYZ ecosystem.

**Troy:** The reason it was pushed was because of security for the DAO. If too much was given out right away, and we've decentralized it completely, then give power to the community. Then some players that were airdropped could join forces and conspire to wreck/rob everyone of everything. 

So, we have to wait a small amount of time so that the project can be decentralized. 

**Tyler:** It's more of overprotection, but it's better to be safe than sorry. We'd feel pretty stupid if the very unlikely that could happen did happen. It's for the long-term safety of the protocol. 

One thing I'd like to add I'm not sure if it's on the Agenda. Talking about audits. I think Ryan should talk about audits at some point on this call. The timing of them and what's coming out. 

**Mark:** We'll talk about that right after I'm done with the airdrops. 

I'm going to mention one more thing about the airdrops. Then I'll get into the auctions and minting. And we'll talk about the audits that we have going on right now.

## Breakdown [[06:38]](https://youtu.be/glRSBWgwQ34?t=398)
(Pooled together)

**Mark:** Just so everyone knows. Those people who are eligible for the airdrops are as follows.

### Discord 6% (Snapshot late February)

**Mark:** Anyone who provided their address in the #xyz-airdrop channel in our Discord.  That airdrop will be about 6% of the tokens, and it's split evenly between all of those people. 

### Original Bidders 2% (Frogs)

**Mark:** Then there are the original bidders of the frogs. We have all of your addresses from February. No need to send them or do anything because we have those addresses already. And that makes up about 2% of the airdrop.

### OG Contributors 9% 

**Mark:** Finally, we have the OG contributors. Who were the original contributors to the original project that we started. They will also get their share.

**Tyler:** That's one actually incorrect thing. When we launched everything the OG contributors ended up going into the vesting contracts. 

**Mark:** Oh! Okay.

**Tyler:** Everything else Mark said was proper‚Äì except that last bit‚Äì and I don't even think you were aware of that. Because I found that out while I was sending out vesting contract info. 

That was also part of the reasoning behind extending the timeline. Because the OG contributors are leaders in the space. Like large DeFi heads and that kind of stuff. If they were part of the airdrop then we may have been able to push it up sooner. But it's safer this way anyway, and it's better they're in vesting contracts on a 100-week vesting schedule.

It's long-term support for the project. It's better that we did it this way in four weeks. But, we also need to wait four weeks.

**Mark:** Completely understandable!

Okay. So, that was my mistake. I was kind of out of the loop there for the last part. 

## Auctions & Minting [[08:41]](https://youtu.be/glRSBWgwQ34?t=521)ü•º‚öóÔ∏è

**Mark:** I'll let Ryan kind of take over for the auctions and the minting. We'll let him talk about the audits we have in process and the launch dates we are looking at. 

### Audits (in progress)

**Ryan:** The first audit that we had in the works was the Hacken audit. 
It's completed, and we're working on revisions for the suggestions that they've made. The key here is to address the recommendations without sacrificing any of the goals. Or the vision that we had in mind for the artists and the community. That's coming together, and internally we're making changes on that front. 

Additionally, we have a Certik audit that's coming up. Mark and I will be doing an AMA with them, which is upcoming. So, that will take some time, but we are making progress there.

Also, we'll have some internal audits where DMOB audits Limchain code and vice versa. This way, we have several pass-throughs of the code before it ever hits production. 

### Launch Dates

**Ryan:** In terms of launch dates, it's hard to say. It depends on the completion of the audits over the next few weeks. In which time it will definitely be coming together. But, it does look as if it's around four weeks out‚Äì until we can go completely live. 

At the end of the day, there is no finalized launch date.

That's for auctions and minting. 

## NFTs & Announcements [[10:07]](https://youtu.be/glRSBWgwQ34?t=607) üååüì¢

### Polymorphs (Coming Soon) 

**Ryan:** For the Polymorphs. The audits haven't started. 

I don't know if we've revealed that about those exist yet. I might be leaking some alpha here. 

The plans for those are in the works as well.

**Mark:** Does Zee want to tell us about the Polymorphs?

(Our newest and latest NFT project.) 

**Tyler:** I don't think we should go into it too much until we are ready to launch‚Äì personally. It's up to yall. But I think we don't leak alpha. Maybe during the call in two weeks, we'll explain what Polymorphs are. 

Because then we'll be two weeks from launching by the sounds of it. I think that we go over it on the next call. 

**Mark:** Sounds good!

### Audits (in progress)

**Ryan:** So, audits are in progress, but you won't know what for until about two weeks from now. 

**Mark:** Exactly!

Start guessing. üòè

Alright, so that's the majority of what we had for today. I think we should try and answer some of the questions from the Discord. 

Real quick, I know I answered a few of them, but I saw some others. 

**Ryan:** Sorry, right before we do the questions. Do we want Al to talk about the OGs and the planets? 


### Finishing OGs / Planets (Coming Soon)

**Mark:** Yeah, let's have Al update us on the planets, the OG characters and the lore‚Äì where everything is at. 

I'm so ready. 

**Tyler:** Just to clarify for everyone. These don't have anything to do with the first drop.

Some of the stuff shared in the community, like the lore, the characters and the planet stuff. That was originally supposed to be the first airdrop. 

But then Limechain‚Äì Zhivko and George came to us with a super dope concept for an NFT launch. From an art and design perspective, it doesn't take as long. So, we decided to prioritize that.

It may launch before the auctions and minting, or it may not. It will depend on the dev team's comfort with everything and the timing. I want to prepare us for that. So no one gets confused.

There will be two core drops that launch quickly after the platform is live. Which will be the Polymorphs and a completely separate thing. Which is a lot of what you all have seen up to this point. Al has been working his ass off on that. So, big hats off to you. That project ended up being a lot larger than I expected.

**Mark:** Yeah, that took...Al, great job on that. 

**Tyler:** It's not a low-effort drop. I can tell you that much. 

**Mark:** Yeah!

**Al:** A part of the reason it may be getting pushed back is that it's not a low-effort drop.

There is so much that goes into it. In our most recent development, we've designed three planets that look great‚Äì based on the lore that we created. So, the planets really connect well with the story. 

The lore I'm talking about is the comics. Those have been progressing very well. We're waiting to get our artists really set on those because they're working on some other things currently. Getting the website set up and all of that. 

Once that is ready. And the comics are ready to be printed. (I meant to say that it's all set up to be cranked out) We, as writers, have so much lore already created for them. When it's time to make the comics, it will be easy to direct the artists and tell them what needs to be done. 

We already have great systems for creating the artwork. Also, great systems for setting up the characters, and those are all pretty much done as well. 

Now, we don't want to release all of the characters too soon. We want to make sure that everything we put out was timed right. Timing is important. So, when we release the figures, we want to make sure it's done right. And the only way we can do that‚Äì is to prepare the whole drop in advance before anything gets released about it. That's how we are planning.

Another thing I want to point out, Tyler said there are around 2 coming out right at the beginning. However, there will likely be more than 2 Core drops in general.  So, just get ready for that. 

**Mark:** We can have 100's of Core drops!

**Al:** Just get ready for us to never stop! Do you know what I mean?

This is only the beginning. Even after these two drops come out‚Äì it's only the beginning. We have so much that's coming. 

**Mark:** Yeah, and honestly, I'm glad we're not talking about the Polymorphs yet. 

I have Ivan making promotional videos for them that we'll put on Youtube.

**Tyler:** I think the Polymorphs are the coolest NFT thing ever.

**Al:** I might make some lore for those as well‚Äì who knows.

**Mark:** Tyler saw the Polymorph figure that was being made this morning...

And he's like...üò§üò§üò§

It was a perfect Tyler moment. 

He said:

> You better make it red!

**Everyone:** üòÇüòÇüòÇ


## Community Questions [[16:06]](https://youtu.be/glRSBWgwQ34?t=966) ‚ùì
(Via Discord in channel #project-management-calls)

**Mark:** Okay, guys, there are a few questions. Let me get through these real quick because I know we have a hard stop. 

I think this person asked a few good questions.

**Question:** 

"Is there a way for community members to make, design or produce their own cartoon/comic or character?"

-Sanwibe-

**Answer:**

**Mark:** The short answer‚Äì yes!

We have a lore team that is the community. It's a bunch of Adult Swim writers, comedy writers that work with Al and a bunch of community members like Underground Man, EgoAssassin. They have been helping write lore, poetry and all sorts of brilliant stuff. 

So, message me or Al. If you guys are trying to get involved and want to help. We're all for it, it's a community-led project, and we want the community involved.

Hit us up if you want to add to our lore and if you want to make characters yourself‚Äì do whatever you want. We'll allow people to mint, and we will let you help however you would like. We are all open to being a team effort here. 

There is one other I liked. 

Actually, that was the main question. A lot of them are the same‚Äì and the rest were pretty much answered. 

**Question:** 

"Do the community members that came up with the idea continue to be apart of the world building?"

-Sanwibe-

**Answer:**

At the end of the day, we are a DAO. We can propose things together and vote alongside one another. There will be the ability to collaborate on drops‚Äì we can come up with something and suggest it to the DAO. Make it a Universe drop. That's the main idea of this, a community-run, decentralized platform that we've built together and where we share ideas. 

Those are some unique questions. Thank you, Sanwibe! 

I think that's all that we have today. Sorry, it's a slightly shorter call. A lot of us have a shortstop here.

**Troy:** Can we see Zee's dog again?

**Mark:** You want to see my dog?

**Troy:** No, Zee's dog! 

**Mark:** Oh!

**Troy:** I want to see your dog too!

**Tyler:** Yeah, me too! 

**Troy:** Zee's dog was paying attention to the meeting. 

**Zhivko:** üòÑ üê∂

**Mark:** My dog left! 

**Tyler:** That's okay!

**Mark:** I kicked my dog out because he whines at me on the calls. He wants to play frisbee and doesn't understand that I'm on this. 

Oh, here he is.  üòÑüê∂

**Tyler:** Does anybody have anything else that they want to go over on this call?

Nice! What's up, Blaze? 

**Dragos:** üòÑüê±

**Tyler:** I'm only asking because I have another call in about 5 minutes. 

Now we have Dragos's cat!

**Troy:** Can you pick up your dogs?

**Tyler:** I don't think I can pick up my dogs...

**Mark:** Pick up, Blue! Pick up, Blue!!!

**Tyler:** Alright, If I can take the camera. I only have two of them here. There is Ganji, and that is Daisy behind there!

 üê∂üê∂

And then this is blue! üê∂

**Mark:** Tyler has 600lbs of dogs. üòÇ

**Tyler:** Yeah...well, not that much...but a lot. 

**Troy:** A lot! üòÇ

**Mark:** Alright.

**Troy:** Cool! 

**Mark:** Thank you, everyone! 

**Zhivko:** Till next time!

**Mark:** Yes, until next time.

Thank you, everyone! 

**Everyone:** üëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëã
