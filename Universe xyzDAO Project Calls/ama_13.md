## Intro

**Mark:** Welcome everyone to our AMA. We will do these bi-weekly. 

The next AMA will be in two weeks, and the Project call next week and will alternate. I'm going to get Rayne to start this week's AMA. Rayne is in charge of support and has been helping organize the discord. He's built a community center for everyone to access and wants to talk about it. 

## Community Center ü§ù [[00:55]](https://youtu.be/0HhWcZQPFII?t=55)

**Rayne:** Thanks, Mark. 

The one thing we noticed was the community consistently asking about a better way for us to communicate, get general updates, and things happening behind the scenes. A week ago, we released the community center, which is in one place that anybody can go to, and it's public. There's a URL I'll drop in the chat, in general, and in the Pre AMA. Anything that you guys can think of will be helpful for us to get our messages across to you or any development changes. Feel free to tell us to add something you'd like to see in the community center. An important thing for it will be the sprint tracker. The sprint tracker will be where anybody from the community can go and see what we are prioritizing. There will be a message board where our AMA notes will get posted and links to YouTube.

There are specific categories that explain different parts of Universe. So there's a DAO category, a protocol category, and a general guide. The whole point of this is to get our links, content, and all the things Universe is working on in one spot and can be easily accessed. There will be a video walk-through coming out soon. I'm just designing and planning it. 

**Mark** Thank you, Rayne. 

Rayne took this upon himself because he has been one of the more active people in discord. He wanted to create a center where you could find the information in the discord that is asked and have more transparency for everyone and the community. Great work, Rayne, and we appreciate you. We'll post those links on the AMA channel, and we'll post that in the comments on YouTube. We'll hand it off to Ryan next to go over the development updates. 

## Development Updates üß∞ [[03:49]](https://youtu.be/0HhWcZQPFII?t=229)

**Ryan:** Thank you, Mark. The big update is that we're testing the next big push. Once that's finished testing over the next few days, it will be live. It's going to contain all the fun Open Graph and NCO stuff. What that means is when you send a link to Universe, whether it be over discord, slack, text message, or telegram, it's going to show up showing either the user you're linking to or the NFT itself. The collection and all various sorts of information and imagery will be displayed. It will enhance the social experience and the ability to relay links to Universe when doing day-to-day NFT stuff with your friends. There will be a big migration we're working on for our databasea and pushing out a handful of new features that require this migration support upon completion. It will allow us to do searching and filtering and have fast results and excellent aggregation of all the data involved in all the complex filters we want to provide. We're expecting it to be in about two weeks. 

That covers the high-level stuff that you are all interested in. Other work is being done on features. One that's really of interest is the finder's fee. While we support royalty splits already, we're adding further integration to our front-end and the back-end to make that a seamless experience for anyone who wants to plug in and inject royalties into Universe orders. 

We can hand it over to Zach, and he can tell everyone about the latest in the Polymorphic Universe. 

## Polymorphic Universe ü§° [[06:05]](https://youtu.be/0HhWcZQPFII?t=365)

**Zach:** Rayne brought to my attention that the last two AMA's I recorded in mono by accident, so I had to change some things. I've been working with the Polymorph development team, a completely separate team from the marketplace. We are getting close to getting the burn to mint out. I will say that there are things you won't be able to get unless you migrate over to the new Polymorph contract in the future. I'll be able to share more about it soon. I want to iron everything out with the dev team first so I don't misspeak. I believe that we're dialing in for the front-end changes and migrating the Polymorph home page onto its separate domain. Correct Ryan. It's a separate domain, but it's still part of Universe domain.

**Ryan:** I believe it will be a subdomain.

**Zach:** You are then getting some of those extra incentives involved with burning your original Polymorph for a V2 one, all lined out on a contract level. 

**Mark:** There will be some pretty exciting game theory approaches for the Polymorphs, and it will put an interesting dynamic on what people do. We can open this up to the AMA section of this call. We still want to give general updates to everyone. Did we put out a forum?

**Zach:** I don't think there were any entries in it, but if anybody here has questions, you can throw them in there.

## Community Questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è [[08:39]](https://youtu.be/0HhWcZQPFII?t=519)

### **Questions:** ‚ùì

What about ERC-1155 support?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** We are actively working on that. There's a development team dedicated to that, and we're not able to give deadlines on it.

**Mark:** The 1155 support is going to be more on the marketplace side. We're going to support 1155, which already exists. Then we will support 1155 minting. We are bringing all the regular buying listings, able to bid and buy multiple 1155s of the same NFT at the same time. This next sprint update will be strictly on the marketplace side. 

**Ryan:** There won't be minting support when it launches at first. You won't be able to create new 1155s from our marketplace or, more specifically, from Universe minting until we add support. There will be existing 1155s and new ones that are minted to the chain. You'll be able to actively make offers, list them for sale if you own them, and purchase them if they're listed.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Will there be a time window to burn poly? Or will we be able to do it anytime in the future?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** Zach, do you want to touch on that?

**Mark:** I can touch on it, and Zach can add. Our last conversation on this, is that it's undecided. 

**Zach:** It will be open indefinitely, so you can always transfer over. We don't want to block anybody who is having a hard time deciding in the first month of it being live. Or from participating later down the line and things you need the V2 Polymorphs for. 

There may be a deadline on a certain claim or a whitelist spot in the future. That will be determined later, but the burn to mint will stay open even if you miss out on claiming something cool.

I just want to say the POAP bot will never DM you first. I just put that in the claim chat. You must DM the POAP bot. We haven't given you the word yet for it.

**Ryan:** If there is a POAP bot DM you. It's not a real POAP bot; it's a scam. 

**Nick:** Report them in the discord or to Rayne. ‚òùÔ∏è

**Ryan:** If we do, we'll tag you in the Universe channel first. We won't ever drop a mint 5 minutes before it goes live. So god forbid any extreme case scenarios like the Apes. That's also something to be cautious of here and in many other communities.

**Zach:** If you DM the POAP bot, it will return a link, and the keyword is **trollgod**. One word, all lower case.

**Mark:** We don't have too many questions. Troy, is there anything that you would like to talk about?

**Troy:** I would say be on the lookout for some interesting open-source stuff coming out. I hate doing this because I'm always cryptic because development takes so long, but it's coming soon, even regarding Graviton. We're testing an app for Xenon in the Xenon chat I posted, and it's in test flight right now. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What does it mean for our current Polymorphs holding?

### **Answer:**

**Zach:** Are you saying what does burn to mint mean?

**Mark:** I think what he's asking is; What if I refuse to burn my Polymorph and want to stay as a V1. One thing that we created the Polymorphs out of was game theory. We didn't understand when we first released them and how the rarity would work or how people would utilize the scrambling. We're about to approach another section of the Polymorphs. There are people with a massive Polymorph holding. What does that say about the original Polymorph collection? It's the OG collection of Polymorphs. If people never want to migrate it and migrate over to the new contract, they become more scarce. But then you may miss out on the gaming aspects and things we're working on. It's something I don't know the answer to or what happens to that collection.

If you ever want to scramble your Polymorph, you will have to migrate it. It may become V1 punk conversation, about What's the original punk, and it may not be important for Polymorphs. Tyler, is there anything you'd want to add to that?

**Tyler:** People are going to have to figure it out on their own. üòº

**Mark:** We don't have the answer.

**Zach:** It's hard to say. I can't speak from a value perspective. The only concrete answer here is if the Polymorphs that don't burn over to the V2 contracts won't be able to scramble.

**Mark:** But that's going to be indefinitely open. But as Zach said again, you may get a mint or something for having a V2, which may not be indefinitely open.

**Zach:** Correct, game theory to be had.

**Ryan:** So they're burnable; you can't unburn them; you can burn them forever as long as you have one. So think about it.

**Algy:** Overall we're going to be incentivizing people that burn the Polymorphs. So the only benefit to not burning would be if you have a cool Gen1 Polymorph for nostalgia. Other than that, all the utility ongoing will be directed at the V2 Polymorphs.

**Mark:** All your badges will be transferred over. If you have a Virgin Polymorph, that is rare, and you're afraid to migrate it for that reason, all your badges, even if you burn a Virgin, you'll keep that version badge. It's still that blockchain randomness. Just migrate it over to the new contract.

**Zach:** So we're going to honour those badges because of all the scramble history, and we can recover that. The devs might hate me for saying this. Something that I'm excited about is displaying your version history. It's not going to come out at the beginning of burn to mint going live. I'm trying to get it so you can see your version history.

**Mark:** We are talking to different people in the space about analytics and how we need to bring those types of things to Universe. The more this space grows, people need more information. There are some cool projects in the space, bringing on-chain data and turning it into useful information. We will see what we can work out for everyone and what cool features we can get to the front end for Universe.

**Mark:** Should we hit everyone with the POAP word again?

**Zach:** It's **trollgod**. One word, lower case, two ll's. 

**Mark:** Ryan, maybe you want to answer this one.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Are there plans to speed up the marketplace? üèÉ

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** As I was saying, the database migration will speed up the marketplace because all of the requests will be coming from the same place. There are a few things in the works there, like image processing and compression and a better experience on mobile and browser. Once that's implemented, we'll see immediate load times on the marketplace on my NFT page. The answer is yes; we are working on speeding up the marketplace.

**Mark:** Then eventually, we'll stick nitrous boosters on the marketplace. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

My experience has been slow loading images and collections in search?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** The slow loading images and the collection search I addressed that's part of the back-end migration.

**Mark:** The back-end migration and database are going to help with the search. They are also re-architecturing some of the search and trade filtering. So all that's going to be connected. Once we fix that, it's going to super-boost the whole marketplace. I think that's where everyone's going to notice a difference once we hit those upgrades. 

**Zach:** Do we have anything else to go over, or are there any other questions?

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Can we hit the link in the chat?

### **Answer:**

**Zach:** No, don't put any links. You will DM the POAP bot.

**Algy:** Unless somebody wants to raise their hand and ask something, you can do that now.

Somebody came up, husker.ETH raised his hand, and he's up here now. If you unmute your mic, you can speak.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

I was just wondering, is there any update on the Lobby Lobsters or anything like that?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Right now, the Lobby Lobsters have been put on the side. We've donated all the money that we made from Lobby Lobsters. So we do have some stuff that we're working on internally for them. 

**Nick:** We have been talking about utility for the Morph's, marketplace and the deviance. I will say that Lobby Lobsters have come up once or twice.

Well, multiple times. Right now, the focus is on Polymorphs. 

**Mark:** Lobby Lobsters is what he means.

**Nick:** Yeah, the Lobby Lobsters. We are building tech for the Polymorphs. That doesn't mean we're not going to incentivize people to hold their Polymorphs and provide utility for them in the future. You'll see Lobby Lobsters start to trickle down utility to the Lobsters in the future.

**Mark:** I can say we are working on a pretty large project related to Universe, but it isn't going to be necessarily Universe. It will be an emerging project. It has plans to incorporate Fluff, Polymorphs, Goblin Town, Lobby Lobsters, and the whole ecosystem that we have been building. You will see us build something to incorporate all of those. I'm not going to say it's the Metaverse.

Tyler just said it is a Metaverse, and Tyler is the one building it.

**Nick:** While we are a little more secretive on the Polymorph and the Lobby Lobsters side of things, that's how NFT projects are run, and they are still DAO run. Let's say they are letting people get integrated into the other side. The DAO could come in and vote so we could integrate with that project. The community still has their say on what we do with the Polymorphs and the funds. You just got to create a proposal and have a good idea behind it because people are going to ask questions.

**Mark:** Any proposals set through our forum discussions get brought up to vote, so if people want stuff built, we will build anything that you ask us to build. Even if it takes us to set up bounties and hire developers from the community to build it out, that's how decentralized DAOs function or need to function. The DAOs can become the same ecosystem where you have 10,000 devs writing code for Universe. That's the importance of creating an open-source protocol.

Eventually, Universe will get to that point. Whether directly plugging into it the same way that you can Etherium or doing it through bounties and getting access through the internal team.

**Zach:** Huskers initial question was about the Lobsters, right? ü¶û

**Mark:** The short answer about the Lobsters is, we are thinking about them and trying to figure out how to incorporate them without having to take a bunch of money because we gave the money away. But we are working on integrating them as much as we can into everything.

**Zach:** Holding a lobster will at least give you perks on some things in the future.

**Algy:** But to be clear. Currently, there is zero development going on for anything lobster-related at Universe. If we wanted to start something, it would have to go through a DAO vote, and we would let everyone know. When we made them, they were a donation. 

**Mark:** I want to say that we do have resale money that has come in from the Lobby Lobsters. I don't know the exact number. It might be two or three ETH, maybe more, but nothing really to donate yet. We've had people from Britain and other countries reach out and say lobbying efforts in our countries would be cool. We're entirely open to donating funds and continuing that, and staying true to our word. It just didn't work out how we thought it was going to. We were hoping the secondary donations would fall behind, and they didn't. We always want to try to be bipartisan and help crypto communities.

We're not worried about Democrats or Republicans. We could probably get more attention on them towards the elections and give them some love. 

**Algy:** The Lobsters were a huge success. We raised about 4 million, and we've gotten some of the best PR from that drop than anything else we've done. 

**Ryan:** That was the largest donation that the coin sender had ever received if I remember correctly.

**Mark:** They said it was three years' worth of runway. 

**Ryan:** If you guys are familiar with their work, check them out on twitter and their writings. They are active and have interns looking at every new legal document that hits their desks. They can find the one thing that could be bad for all of us in the middle of these things. I'm grateful for them being able to do that and being passionate about crypto, just like the rest of us.

**Mark:** People in this AMA right now listen and follow Niraj on twitter, and he's out there fighting for all of you guys, and it's an amazing group. They get in front of Congress and the Senate. 

**Ryan:** It's incredible. The stuff they are able to catch is wild.

**Nick:** Does anyone have any more questions, or should we drop the POAP code one more time and end it.

**Algy:** **trollgod**, all lower case, no spaces.

**Nick:** Like, subscribe, and follow us on Youtube.

**Ryan:** Thanks, everyone.

**Nick:** Thanks, guys. 

Thanks for listening. Bye. ‚úåÔ∏è
