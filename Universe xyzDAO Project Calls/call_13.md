## Intro

**Mark:** Hey everyone. Welcome to Project Call #13! 

Almost half a year of the project calls so far, so that's exciting. I want to go ahead and jump into some updates on products. This is going to be a product update call.

## Auctions & Minting (Mark) ü•º‚öóÔ∏è [[00:24]](https://youtu.be/U1S6s3Lvdt8?t=24)

**Mark:** It looks like we're getting closer to getting the beta testing out. We ran into some hiccups this week. We hoped we could get it out by this time, but we will have that test environment up next week. Then we'll have beta testing allowed for the people who we already told can start testing. So if you know who you are, you know.

**Mark:** We're going to allow some of the original contributors, a ton of the OGs in our discord, the original 100 discretionary people who we thought had helped the most along the way. From NFPepe, into our token launching and yield farming. These people have kind of been with us the whole way. So they're going to be the first ones to kind of get eyes on the product, and we're going to have the OGs beta test. So we'll have like probably 350 sets of eyes on this. So hopefully, we can catch everything before we release this live product so everyone can use it.

**Mark:** Minting is going to release a little bit sooner than the auctions. We had plans to roll them out together, but as I said, we had run into some hiccups, and we want to go ahead and get the minting out because it's ready. If everything goes to plan with testing, we could hopefully get this out **ASAP**. And that is just going to be a decentralized NFT minting platform to start, and then it will be followed up by our auction's platform. The auctions platform got a little bit postponed just because we ran into project management hiccups.

**Mark:** We're going to learn from our mistakes and get it better. But the auctions, when you see it, are a lot of pages, and we're having to do a few re renderings of some flows and just make sure everything is going accordingly with these audits and some of the revisions we need to make. We've decided to release the minting a little bit earlier, and the auctions will come out as soon as we can get them out afterwards. But they're just as far along.

**Mark:** We need to fix some of these things, and we don't want the minting to get held up. Because we know a lot of people that are interested in the minting itself. If we can get that out ASAP, that's kind of our game plan. Testing for the auctions is going to be live also. We're hoping within the next two or three weeks. We can maybe spend time to get a test environment up‚Äî it all depends on us getting some of these changes that we need to make fixed.

**Mark:** I don't have a time frame right now for that. Although, within the next call, we'll have a better understanding. Or maybe even we have something out for the auctions by then. These are necessary revisions that we need to make. This is part of the progress of building smart contracts and front-end code like this. You have to make revisions. Anyone does. That's kind of been a part of the process of doing this stuff. You fix one thing. Another problem can pop up. That's kind of where we're at. However, we're working through it, and we're going to get through it pretty quickly.

**Mark:** So those are our updates for the auctions and minting. The main thing to take away from that is that minting will come out a little bit sooner than auctions. That's kind of the main change here. I can let Ryan give a few updates on the marketplace.

**Mark:** Ryan, do you want to give some updates there? We're still working on smart contracts. We're exploring all sorts of stuff. I'll let Ryan kind of take care of that.

## Marketplace üñº [[4:57]](https://youtu.be/U1S6s3Lvdt8?t=297)

**Ryan:** I mean, as you said, Mark. We're working on the smart contracts. (They are in progress) We're adding some unique features, but I'm not going to leak any alpha today on what exactly we're throwing in there. Timeline-wise, it is hard to say how long it will take for this to get put together because while the smart contracts are almost done and will get sent into audit soon, there's a whole ecosystem of stuff that has to be put together. It could take a little bit, but we're excited to push it through.

**Mark:** Then hopefully, some of these hiccups that we ran into on this first go around. We can correct the problems. Hopefully, we don't run into the same issues with the marketplace. This is a learning experience for the whole team. This is personally one of the larger projects I've ever built from a Web3 perspective. So I've had some personal learning curves that I've had to take on. So this is a massive effort from everyone. No one's to blame for this. This is just part of development. You run into hiccups, and you need to change them. So thank you for the update, Ryan. We're in progress on the smart contracts for the marketplace. So, everything's coming along. Although, with how the development process is going. We're a tad unsure about a timeline. 

One last thing we'd like to talk about. We have a pretty short call because our updates are mostly product updates, and we don't want to leak a ton of information. I think we've learned our lesson about leaking information. We don't want anyone stealing our ideas. But honestly, we're trying to give you all as much information as possible without revealing too much.

## [EnterDAO](enterdao.xyz) üîÆ üßô [[7:02]](https://youtu.be/U1S6s3Lvdt8?t=422)

**Mark:** The last thing we want to talk about is Enter DAO, which is a partnership that our friends [Lime Chain](https://limechain.tech/) have started. And just so everyone knows, Lime Chain is a pretty big dev shop. What's going on with Enter DAO will not take away from what Universe is doing. If anything, it will help us a lot with the alignment. Especially considering what they're building. The tools they have planned are even more aligned with Universe and what we aim to accomplish in the future. This project is controlled by some of the lead devs at Lime Chain. It's not the primary people who are working on Universe. So, there will be no friction there to slow us down.

* [Lime Chain Twitter](https://twitter.com/LimeChainHQ)

**Tyler:** I don't mean to interrupt you just because I can probably talk to this the most. And so, I'm listed as a core team member on Enter DAO. This will be the same for [League DAO](https://leaguedao.com/) when it drops as well. Because I was on a call with one of the larger VCs in Asia. They're a considerable force in Defi funds. Consider them like the [Framework](https://framework.ventures/) or the [ParaFi](https://www.parafi.capital/) of Asia, and they were asking about some of these projects because it's got them more interested in Universe. They're starting to look at it as an ecosystem. 

**Tyler:** So, we have our main products coming out‚Äî that are under the Universe umbrella ‚Äîwe have three parallel dev teams that work on Universe, and everybody's like busting ass. Lime Chain originally came on as advisors for this project. Because we had worked together historically on a project called [Bond.Bet](https://bond.bet/) through [Barn Bridge](https://barnbridge.com/), (Over Christmas break at one point) they were amazing to work with. So when we realized we were going to need a lot of dev resources to build something like Universe at scale. Not only the auctions, minting and marketplace. Everything that we plan to create in the long term. We knew that we were going to need a lot of talent.

**Tyler:** So, since (George has been on a lot of these calls) [George](https://twitter.com/GSpasov) and [Z](https://twitter.com/zhivkoto) run Lime Chain, which is like an 80 person dev shop, their brains are invaluable from the perspective of architecture. They're also extremely involved in Universe. But, they're doing it because of a general passion for the Metaverse. 

Lime Chain wrote the [Polymorphs contracts](https://github.com/UniverseXYZ/Polymorph-Contracts). They even got the back end up. They did a lot of heavy work, essentially‚Äî for free. A lot of the back-end work was done over essentially a weekend. When we worked on Polymorphs, we planned for a party on CryptoVoxels or some area that would generate a ton of high foot traffic. It would cost us a million dollars to buy a lot of land, and that wasn't worth throwing a party over.

With us doing a lot of work from a 3D perspective and modelling that we're doing with the Polymorphs. (I'm not trying to leak too much alpha) But, there's been a lot of research in our kind of off time. Weekend exploratory passion projects have turned into what Enter DAO has become. As a way to return the favour a bit, for helping us so much with Polymorphs. And going so far beyond what we would have ever expected an advisor to do. I helped them raise capital and introduced them to a number of my contacts and VCs. 

The overall concept here was very similar to my view of League DAO. We have very passionate people that have shown up, stood up, committed code and gone above and beyond. These are things that will integrate with Universe. Having a full-on Metaverse play will differentiate us in the future from other platforms that don't innovate in that direction. And try to be a pure marketplace. We never had the ambitions of only being a marketplace. Even though, since we started, between February and now. Marketplaces have gone up to billions of dollars in volume. That carrot has grown. Even at the onset, we wanted it to be a complete Universe for the Metaverse. It will cost money, and we don't want to distract dev resources. Having a sister project where their founders and our founders are all building very close with each other is not only going to help us, it's going to help Enter DAO.

**Tyler:** Same with if people have seen me off playing around with League DAO, same thing. You're going to be able to essentially get League tokens utilizing XYZ. Even the League token will generate Enter tokens and vice-versa. The plan here is similar to our yield farming concept. We gave it to projects like Illuvium. Who's been a brilliant partner. Then all of the DeFi projects. The plan was to use proof of capital and fair launch distributions to align ourselves with those communities. So our communities were their communities, and we could work with them over the long haul. With the way we designed this, you can assume the Enter DAO community gets included. Massive shout-out to Lime Chain. I believe there is around USD 20 million right now, staked in TVL waiting for Enter tokens. When League DAO launches, their auctions will eventually be through the marketplace. So, you're looking at things that aren't a core focus of ours that we do have passionate team show up that we've worked within the past. They're very closely linked to the project.

**Tyler:** If they want to do their things. Instead of taking resources away from Universe and going off and building those things, which could be a distraction. (I almost want to write a blog post about this.) But in Boomer SAS, you have vertical expansion. You have one company that will expand vertically and get as much land grab as possible. In Web3 because of incentives. It's sensible to aim for horizontal expansion, where we're building very closely with these teams, but they're focused on their own thing. And ultimately, it's better for Universe if we have a very close, Metaverse partner that we're going to support as much as they help us. And try to go above and beyond in supporting them to return that favour. Same with League DAO. It doesn't hurt us to have a fantasy football or a fantasy sports NFT project. It wasn't a focus that we were working on. Now it's very close to the Universe ecosystem that we'll be able to build with them and focus on‚Äî but without taking away resources from what we're working on.

**Tyler:** I wouldn't consider Enter DAO the same thing as League DAO. But I would consider it something that is going to push‚Äî I'm sorry, I wouldn't consider Enter DAO the same thing as Universe and same so League DAO. But, I assume that both of them will be things that push Universe forward. Where those people slightly piggyback off the community that we built. They will return the favour by creating very close to us. As opposed to building close to something deemed as a competitor. I believe, because I'm involved in those more closely, it helps when I give that insight into what the thought process was there and why we're doing it. Also, a massive shout out to the Enter DAO team for the early success. Because it's looking like it's going to be a fun project.

**Mark:** Yeah, exactly. Thank you for the rundown on that. The main reason we're bringing up Enter DAO. To reiterate what Tyler said‚Äî we are incredibly aligned with them. You can go to [enterdao.xyz](enterdao.xyz), and you can farm Enter DAO tokens with your XYZ. 

As Tyler said, there will be more opportunities to farm with your XYZ, like League. (League DAO) I believe that will be the token name‚Äî League ‚Äîand then past pools. You know, there was an [Illuvium flash pool](https://staking.illuvium.io/staking/0x4C6997D462b0146fA54b747065411C1Ba0248595/analytics) a few weeks ago. So, some neat opportunities to farm with XYZ this past month and in the future. So, look out for those. We can drop a link in the discord. I'm sure it's already been passed around, and people have seen it. Also, people have noticed the code got forked. I'm pretty sure they went and forked the Barn Bridge or the XYZ Universe DAO. Our community should be very familiar with the front end and how to stake and navigate. You can go there and play around. Check it out. We want to disclose that some of us are backers.

**Mark:** We are involved with the team, not all of us. We don't work on this project as Tyler said. But, we participate in the project in some capacity. Some of us on this call are interested in the project. So, I want to disclose that.

**Tyler:** So everyone knows our DAO and yield farming contracts are open source. People are welcome to fork those. If you use our code, we can't consult on how to do this because we're too busy. But, if you end up using our code and are that close to us and you're building like a Metaverse project, reach out and communicate with us. We want to know about it. We want to know what's getting built in the space. That's why they're open source. I mean, they came from Barn Bridge. We used the contracts with Universe, and they're battle-tested. The DAO is very effective at doing what it does. And the yield farming contracts (I think between Universe and Barn Bridge) have probably had billions of dollars on top of them and haven't been hacked or seen issues. So, we want other people in the ecosystem to use them because we think they're safe. 

## Community Questions‚ùì[[19:32]](https://youtu.be/U1S6s3Lvdt8?t=1172)

**Mark:** All right, so that looks like everything for the call today. But we do have some questions from the community. 

It looks like Resistance has two pretty good questions.

**Mark:** [[19:48]](https://youtu.be/U1S6s3Lvdt8?t=1188)
**Question:** will it be possible to create private sales on Universe Marketplace? And will there be any collection fees on private sales?

**Answer:** We are working on private sales. I'm not sure our V1 Marketplace is going to support private sales. But, I don't want to speak too soon. However, I want to say that if you want a private sale through our interface, we probably...actually, I don't know.

**Tyler:** Is there somewhere that permits private sales? 

Because it's on-chain, you can see where it goes.

(20:34) MIC CONFUSION üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

**Nick:** I can hear him. 

I don't know why Mark can't hear you.

**Tyler:** Okay, sorry. I don't know why. I would love to see some examples of what they mean by private sales. This is not a feature that we're building into V1. I've thought about this before because a lot of what people are using on Larva Labs is like, you'll see a transfer, essentially, this isn't Doxing G money, but I've seen him acquire his punks via transfers. This means he's going out to people he knows, paying them, and then someone transfers it to him. Well, maybe they don't want to list the price it sold for. You obviously can't show that. But, you can't stop showing the wallet that it went to. To clarify what we mean by private transfers. If that's like a concrete ask. There are a couple of things that we need to think through as a community. One will be money laundering because we don't want to be utilized that way. That will put us under investigation. That concept, if you're transferring NFTs and you somehow tornado cash, then mask where it's going to, it could be used for nefarious reasons.

**Tyler:** Maybe that's the whole protocol that someone needs to work on and build. If you're just talking about the kind of masking what you sold the thing for, if you're an artist, you may have reasons for that being published or not. I think that we could, theoretically‚Äî if that becomes a super requested feature ‚Äîassist the community in building long term. The way that I thought that it could function would be:

**Tyler:** There's some type of escrow where you send your punk into an escrow, someone sends $300,000 into the escrow, and then it transfers to another address or the address that you've decided on. Although, even that isn't completely private, right? All that information is on-chain.

**Troy:** The way you would want to do it is, you do it with zero knowledge.

**Tyler:** Yeah, I guess my point is you're talking about making like kind of a tornado cash type.

**Troy:** Exactly. That's what it is.

**Tyler:** It's easier said than done. We've thought about it and are thinking about it. If it becomes a massively requested feature by artists. Then I think we'd add it. If it's a massively requested feature by Degens, I think we need to kind of dig into why they want it. Because realistically, that could get built away from Universe. If we get the vibe that it's getting used for the wrong reasons.

**Mark:** I think that's a good answer and I believe that is everything for today. We love you all. 

Hit like and subscribe. Follow us on the next project call. In two weeks. 

Do we have any other updates to include?

**Nick:** I think we're good.

**Mark:** Go, Tom Brady. Alright, everyone. üëã

**Troy:** Alright, later, everyone. ‚úåÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è ‚úåÔ∏è
