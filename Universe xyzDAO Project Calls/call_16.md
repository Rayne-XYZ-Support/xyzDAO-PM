## Intro

**Mark:** Hey everyone, welcome to Project call number 16. 

We're super excited to have another project call with you guys. So we'll dive right into it, and we'll go ahead and say thank you to every single person involved in this epic party that we had this past week. I just got in this morning. I had an insane blast. I'm sure everyone else on this call that was there had a blast. I know Ryan, Tyler, Dragos, and Trevor did. Honestly, it was a unique, humbling experience. I loved seeing everyone there, and I like to think that all those people had polymorphs, but I know some had other NFTs, but we had great performances from [Kaskade](https://twitter.com/kaskade), [Destructo](https://twitter.com/destructoamf), [Haywyre](https://twitter.com/Haywyremusic). 

We also had some cool curated art from [Murat Pak](https://twitter.com/muratpak), [Toomuchlag](https://twitter.com/toomuchlag), [Ness Graphics](https://twitter.com/Ness_Graphics) and [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher). And also, Toomuchlag made a pretty sick POAP NFT. So if you attended our NFT NYC event, I believe you should be able to claim the Toomuchlag graphic. If you had either used ticket ferry or had a VIP ticket, I can tweet that link later today so that everyone can claim that POAP, but you have to do it before.

I think it was 11:59 p.m. on November 5, so it's free to claim. It goes on your POAP. You use it, your address, and it puts it on there. I'm not sure if those are NFTs, but I'm pretty sure POAP allows you to move some of your POAPs to your actual wallet. But I'm not entirely sure about all that, so don't quote me. Claim your POAP to prove that you were at that awesome epic party. It's what everyone is talking about. And also, we want to thank the community. We couldn't have had an awesome party without you guys, and we love seeing you guys and meeting you in person, especially a lot of our original 32 degens that we have had with us for a long time. So shout out to [Transmental](https://twitter.com/transmental) and shout out to [CryptoProwess](https://twitter.com/CryptoProwess). It was fantastic meeting many of you big guys in our community. So it's cool to put a face to some of you guys and get to meet you, but I'm going to hand it off to Ryan, and he's going to go over some of the progress updates on minting and auctions.

As a lot of you know, we released minting last week, and we're excited about it. 

So, Ryan will give a few updates on that and some stuff we're updating and fixing there.

## Minting & Auctions ü•º‚öóÔ∏è [[03:08]](https://youtu.be/8Hweakx2EEU?t=188)

**Ryan:** Hey guys. So as Mark said, the minting platform has been released officially. We had the soft launch last week, and now it's officially out there. A handful of bugs are harder at work to fix, and then a handful of features are slowly going to be rolled out over the next several months. That will improve the user experience and also create a better minting platform. There are additional plans to add more NFT contract types. Right now, you're dealing with an ERC 721. We plan to extend the other 720 ones with PAK opening capabilities and ERC 1155 and different exciting types of contracts Tim is playing around with. So we're all excited about that. But the devs are hard at work, making that the best possible product they can and making it as easy for you to use it as you can for the auctions. The auctions are slowly starting to come together. It's all very exciting, and we're expecting a launch hopefully in the next month and a half. What's exciting here is that a lot of the auction stuff is essential. You guys have seen the blow drop; you've seen the loom lock drop.

Everybody wants to run a drop much like this. With the auctions, you'll be able to configure them in very similar ways to these drops. So it's taking this very unique and rare drop style, and it's going to offer it as a service. And of course, it's going to be entirely free for you to use. Plus, gas is in progress. And we're all excited to get that out there. After that is the marketplace, which will come after the options are released, I think I can hand it back to Mark to talk about yield farming.


## Yield Farming üöúüåæ [[04:55]](https://youtu.be/8Hweakx2EEU?t=295)

**Mark:** From the last call, I just wanted to reiterate that thanks to you and everyone for yield farming. Our current farms have shut down. So if you have any current XYZ or I'm sorry, not XYZ. If you have any bond sushi or tokens that we were farming with, you're not earning any API or anything on that anymore, so you're free to pull those out. But you're not going to be penalized if you can't if you take it out now. To claim your rewards, you can go ahead and move that to wherever you want to go.

**Tyler:** On the site earlier today, I saw that there's like $40 million still staked on there. Since 4 million is the liquidity pool, I don't know how much of that counts as the DAO. I was looking into some of the pools. Some of them still have a lot of money in there. The compound has 9 million in it. The bond pool has around 670. 

**Mark:** You're not earning anything on that anymore. So definitely take it out, put it wherever you want. There are probably other places to earn a yield on those tokens. But if you're going to farm with XYZ, we have a few opportunities for XYZ. So you have the DAO, which we recommend just because once you get into the DAO, that allows you to participate in governance. Since we are an NFT project, I stress that some people who may not have experience in some DeFi protocols know about governance; I recommend that you stake in the DAO and participate in those governance votes to learn. If anything, the experience of participating in a vote one time just gives you the vibe of how decentralization and governance can help and work and allow a community to make a decision together. If you haven't done that yet or participated in anything like that and you're interested in learning about it. We have some docs on how to stake in the DAO on our website, vote, and the parameters and rules around that. We have a ton of docs on all that.

Also, you can use XYZ to farm League DAO tokens and Enter DAO tokens. Those are our main updates for this week or over the last 2 weeks. The main thing was that we launched our minting. We're excited that we finally got something out. People have already started minting to the contract. Shout out to [Transmental](https://twitter.com/transmental) for minting, the first one-of-one on Universe Singularity contract. So that's pretty cool that we've already seen people minting, but we expect to see a lot more in the future. With gas prices being so crazy the last few weeks, I don't think we've seen much activity. I don't even think I've seen a ton of NFT drops because of the gas. But we'll work on it together. Ethereum will eventually fix the gas fees, hopefully, but they're out of our control. All right, let me jump over to the community questions. Is there anybody on this call that wants to add anything or, like, shout out anyone? We should probably shout out MonsterCat. Those guys are amazing. They helped had a huge hand in getting a lot of the talent and coordinating the event at the [Hammerstein Ballroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerstein_Ballroom).

It was an excellent venue. [Tim Kang](https://twitter.com/illestrater_), one of our founders, also had a huge part in organizing the event, and so did Tyler, so I just wanted to thank all those guys personally. [Darlington](https://twitter.com/Darlington) at [MonsterCat](https://twitter.com/Monstercat), thanks for helping us throw such a badass party. We couldn't have done it without you guys. And also, just in case anyone missed the party, your FOMO will be multiplied when we release the actual video of the recap because we did have the whole party documented, and who knows what we can do with some of the film. Maybe we'll turn some of the clips into NFT or something, but that's just fun, and we don't have any plans for that. And if you did or didn't go, you'll be able to kind of check out the recap and see how badass it was. Okay, let me jump over to the discord questions. The last question was if we were going to have a cameraman. And yes, we had a cameraman. It was Brandon.

It was Tim's brother. He does a bunch of videos for a bunch of festivals. I've seen some of the videos he makes. It's going to multiply your FOMO, and you're going to be like  I should have gone to this. 

## Community Questions ‚ùì [[11:22]](https://youtu.be/8Hweakx2EEU?t=682)

**Mark:** We have one question. Crypto Daddy 69 asks if we can have a marketing channel. This spitball idea doesn't have to be called marketing. Yes, we can for sure have that. I can go ahead and make a channel today, and we can call it marketing ideas. I do want to address something before we end this call. Just because we are a big community and University has grown to many people. The discord has become a little difficult for the team members to keep up with every conversation. I have a few people in the discord that I keep up with that help me if something important. If I missed it, they'd say, hey, you missed this. And I'll try to go back and address it, but sometimes there are some excellent ideas in the discord, and I don't see it all.

The team doesn't see it all, and sometimes it gets buried because it's in a weird channel. We are cool with creating more channels. We don't want to have thousands of channels because the more we have, the harder discord gets. But stuff like marketing, we can have community-driven decisions on marketing. We can make DAO decisions on marketing. When someone comes up with a cool idea, you're like, oh s___t, this is a cool idea. And maybe the founders didn't respond or see it, tag us and let's start a conversation about it. We're getting to the point where governance is once the marketplace and auctions come out. I feel like we will have many feature requests, and I'd appreciate it if we made some of those feature requests via snapshots. Talking in discord, agreeing and disagreeing, coming up with the best ideas, working on those as a community and then making the decisions together via governance. At this point, I think it's something that we can start thinking about and maybe, getting into the thought process and habit of is just thinking about governance.

And now that we're getting into a stride and start releasing products, I think we're going to start seeing more and more governance proposals, and we want to see some from the community. I believe that you guys have some excellent ideas, and part of it is just hammering us and being like, hey, I think this is a good idea, and then other people being like, yeah, it's a good idea, and we believe it's a good idea. We just got to make these decisions together kind of thing. And honestly, I want you all to know we're trying our best. There are, like, 50 channels in our discord. We try to keep up with it all, but we miss stuff every once in a while. So if you felt like you had a great idea that got pushed under the rug, start a conversation again, and we'll join in, and we'll go over it and maybe it's something that we all agree that we would like to put a governance proposal and to make a change or add a feature or do something like that. But I just wanted to go over that because, as I said earlier on the call, many NFT communities aren't entirely aware of or understand the whole governance process and how powerful it is driving community decisions.

So I encourage everyone to read the documents on the website in the gitbooks. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me or DM me. I'll try to help as much as I can. Also, there are tons of people in the discord. All of our original OGS and Dejan are in the chat. They can help you with simple questions, but we're here to help. Don't be afraid to ask questions twice; that is what I'm saying, but all right. We appreciate you all. Does anybody have anything else they want to add or speak to the community? We love you, community. I'll say it for all of us at Universe. All right, hit subscribe share with your mother. Tell your grandma you bought a new NFT. Be safe out there; everyone who's still in New York City enjoys having as much fun as possible. And thank you all for coming to our NFT-NYC party. We had a blast, and we love seeing you all. So thank you, everyone. We couldn't have done it without you all. You're real MVPs. 

See you.

**Tyler:** Bye, everybody.
