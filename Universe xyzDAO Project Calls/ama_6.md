## Intro

**Mark:** Today will be different because we don't have much of an agenda for everybody.  

We're pretty close to the ending stages, and we're just wrapping up some stuff. We're just going to open it up to the community for questions. Hopefully, the Marketplace is out next week. 

We don't have any massive updates for anybody.

## DAO Vote [[00:45]](https://youtu.be/MlmaMbrq2do?t=45) üó≥

**Tyler:** I guess one update before we jump in is, and I want to be clear about it. We still have to put this through a DAO vote when we say that we're launching or releasing. We're working on the final stages, and every day we get closer. I've seen people posting that on March 5, and I want to clarify that my idea of launching is different from everyone else's because this is a DAO. 

The DAO has too launch the protocol. If it gets delayed in any capacity, it's not going to get delayed substantially past March 5. We're testing everything iteratively; it has warm-up stages, the DAO vote happens, then there's execution. So we're not just going to launch these contracts‚Äî It's launched via the DAO ‚Äîwhich is the point of everybody having tokens.

## Pre AMA Questions [[02:28]](https://youtu.be/MlmaMbrq2do?t=148) ‚ùì

**Mark:** I am looking for new questions that we didn't answer. 

We don't have too many questions. If anybody has questions, they can come up and ask them directly, or you can type them in the Pre AMA channel. ‚òéÔ∏è

### **Question: TaeKwonKrypto**

Will 1155 be available? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think Ryan is the best person to answer that question.

**Ryan:** They won't be supported in the 1st week of launch, but they are high-priority tickets in the 1st round of iterations. üßë‚Äçüîß

**Algy:** Just to expand on that. We are aware of what the community wants as far as minting features. We want to push to get lazy minting features, ERC 1155 support, and maybe even other token standards that will allow people to have several options when they're minting NFTs.

**Tyler:** In the last AMA, we talked about how we had to pull things out for launch that were already far along in the pipeline. 

Even auctions themselves; we stopped talking about them. 

We have added code and work that we've done got pulled out for the testing. I don't want to call it a beta release, and it still is an alpha release. It will work from here because we'll ultimately be working with 2-week sprints. Everything up to this point was just a prolonged to get this out. Now we can prioritize features that need to be in every sprint. That doesn't mean that we're releasing an incomplete product. It means that every product is incomplete, and you continue to iterate and add on it. There's a rapid iteration that's going to come between launch and subsequent sprints.

## **Question: TaeKwonKrypto**

Is there an easy button to list 250 copies of this X price NFT, or do I have to list 1 NFT for this price 250 times? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Short answer is yes. 

We are looking at batching and batch listing functions. More things will come in one of those 2nd iterations Chuba talked about; we are definitely looking into this stuff and have been building this. It's not in the V1 version. I don't think anyone mentioned that ERC 721 is still the premier NFT; 1155 has the use cases they're good for but not as adopted.

**Ryan:** They're common enough that we will support them very quickly. 

We have already tested it on the Marketplace regarding the question of being able to list multiple in 1 transaction or 1 per order. You will be able to do that when they go live. Some of the things that Tyler said earlier had to be gutted so that we can get the V1 shipped as quickly as possible.

**Mark:** Most of that was focused towards ERC 721, but we are very interested in other token standards. There are different ones that people are experimenting with it. 1155 is one of those massive use cases that people like to mint. So we are going to support those. 

Thank you, TaeKwonKrypto. Those are good questions. üëç

### **Question: anims515 | RobotEars.eth**

How will we connect to the Marketplace? 

Will universe.xyz turn into the new homepage? Does being on the protocol level mean there be an app.universe.xyz like Uniswap?

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** If you go to the new Universe site once the Marketplace is launched. There will be a button and drop down, much like all of the other product drops.

There's a minting button. There'll be an NFT Marketplace button where you can search for collections that you're interested in trading. You can browse the NFTs that are for sale. Then you can already see your NFTs page, and you will be able to list them for sale there. It's not going to be a new app. It'll be integrated into the main site that everyone's already used to seeing.

**Mark:** It'll be on the same domain. 

**Ryan:** Let me add one thing because we plan to support Gem and Genie. 

Not immediately at launch, but very quickly after. You will be able to trade Universe listed NFTS on those platforms. Like all the aggregators, that's an integration that we very much want to prioritize. ü§ù

**Mark:** I think people would be interested in that.

**Tyler:** Just that question in general, the website is easier to change than the application itself. 

We probably should think more about the website itself and push more to the Marketplace. We haven't had that conversation yet. Most people are going to be posting the Marketplace in social forums. If we decide that people are going to Universe.XYZ doesn't realize it has a Marketplace; we can always change that later. Let's make it a problem when it is one, but the website itself is pretty easy to change.

**Ryan:** If we want the home page to show off all the NFTs and merge with the browse page, these are all options on the table, snapshot; that's an excellent place to put things like that through initially. We're open to anything like that for sure.

**Tyler:** I'm not even talking about front-end UI features. I'm talking about the website itself, and the website points to an application.

### **Question: lookatme**

Are the Lobby Lobsters NFTs any good for upcoming projects like Whitelist, etc? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Right now, we don't have any plans. 

There is one that Lobby Lobsters will be able to mint‚Äî the [Coldest Drop NFT collection](https://thecoldestdrop.xyz/). They're a group of our partners we've been working with for the last few years, and they are building a pretty sick game. I probably shouldn't talk too much about it, but the Lobby Lobsters will be a whitelist opportunity for the [Coldest Drop](https://twitter.com/thecoldestdrop). We are focused on getting Polymorphs and Lobby Lobsters on more whitelists from a developmental perspective. Currently, [ZooDAO](https://twitter.com/ZooDAO) is releasing some contracts where you'll be able to stake NFTs and battle them. 

Lobby Lobsters will be on that. We're also talking to the [Worldwide Web](https://twitter.com/Worldwide_WEB3) about getting the Polymorphs and Lobby Lobsters on there. We will continue to work on whitelists and opportunities for holders of the Lobby Lobsters. This past month we have been extremely focused on the Marketplace, and that's our main focus. But as we get a little more free time, we will be trying to expand to more projects. Some projects have just been willingly listing the Lobby Lobsters because they think that the Lobby Lobsters were sick, community-driven drop.

**Algy:** Always remember that they exist because we have to donate to a cause. 

We will probably get everyone's opinion soon on what the next donation will go to. As far as the funds from the resales, there are still news articles posted pretty frequently. Long after, we initially released and explained to people what we did with the NFTs to make a raise for a good cause.

**Tyler:** It inspired other raises. The larger raise came out of Ukraine. Our Ukrainian team did a Ukraine drop, but it was the day after the much larger Ukraine drop that was with the [PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO) folks.

I would look at it in 2 ways. Lobby Lobsters, we donated the funds that were raised. We were super communicative about what we were doing with them. So in the two lights; Tyler as someone that works directly on Universe, and then Tyler is a Universe community member. I have lots of Lobby Lobsters, and as a community member on things that I work on, I'm going to want to include them in those.  

We shied away from doing NFT drops because we're ultimately working on the Marketplace. We do have NFT drops planned. We're working on a lot of stuff in that capacity, and we're not going to turn our backs on Lobby Lobsters even as community members of Lobby Lobsters. 

They're creative commons, and we can build them into whatever we want to because we're passionate about them. The ongoing funds from Lobby Lobsters secondary also are going to lobbying efforts. What Lobby Lobsters truly was a framework for doing more honourable causes. I think that the entire industry is starting to see people arguing about it. People are basically saying that people weren't donating to Ukraine until there was extractable value. I'm afraid I have to disagree with that because there was a lot of money donated before that. I believe in allowing people to direct funds towards causes. I 100% believe that Lobby Lobsters kicked that off and will continue to be pioneers. The actual Lobby Lobsters don't have any type of budget. If it was a rug, it was a rug that we all agreed to do and to give the funds to lobbying efforts. Those lobbying efforts are ongoing.

We gave more money to it, and it was multiple years of runway for the organization we donated to. It was more money than they've ever had donated to them in their entire budget. Those people are in Washington fighting for Crypto. You guys can follow that group [Coin Center](https://twitter.com/coincenter) and [Neeraj](https://twitter.com/NeerajKA), and they're constantly talking about the conversations that they're having. So the Lobby Lobsters are helping. We get these questions all the time. I always feel like people are asking us to defend the price, which we're not going to do, or to say that there's going to be this ongoing committed development from some team that we raise capital off of and are compensating, and that's not the case. 

We told everybody that we were giving the funds away. That's what we did with the funds, and we all agreed to that. As a community member, wanting to build stuff into them is very different than being a core team member. We're also not stopping any community members from wanting to do cool stuff with Lobby Lobsters. ü¶û

**Nick:** We have a Polymorph team, but we do not have a Lobby Lobsters team, but we will continue to add them to stuff when we're able to. It's convenient for the community. But what we're trying to say is we're not going to go out of our way to build cool things.

**Algy:** Specifically, what Nick is saying. Anything that happens will be through a DAO vote.

**Mark:** After this conversation, I wanted to shout out because we put together that Ukraine drop, but it wasn't us. It was the Ukrainian team that worked for us. Pablo is in here. Pablo wants to come up and say anything about the Ukraine drop. I think it would be better. Pavlo, do you want to come up.

**Tyler:** Pavlo may also help because the more important question they ask is how the Ukrainian team is doing. I feel like you should be the one to answer that. I can answer it for you if you don't want to talk.

**Pavlo:** I can. Do you hear me, guys?

**Ryan:** Yes, we can hear you.

**Pablo:** Hi, everyone. I joined late, but I heard the question, so I think I can answer that. Ukraine is going through hard times right now. 

I'm not going to dive much into politics, but it's just a matter of it's a real war, missile strikes, and people are suffering, especially civilians. It hasn't been safe for them in those parts of Ukraine where all of this is actually happening. We've been trying to help them move to safe places as much as possible. I am safe right now. For this job, though, we try to make this stand with Ukraine. NFT dropped for the Ukrainian Army and the Ukrainian people because the Ukrainian Army is the guys protecting the civilians right now. So we self-organized over the weekend. We had pure support from everyone from the Universe team. We organized this drop, and it's available by the links done with the Ukraine community. It was organized for 72 hours, and the minting is going to be available for another 19 hours. If you haven't checked that, feel free to. But we got a bunch of funds collected, and I want to say I really appreciate all of your guy's support. It's really what the people of Ukraine need right now because it's not that easy. So I do appreciate that. Thank you for all your support during these days. I'm just grateful and excited to be a part of this community. 

I think that going forward, and we'll be able to do great stuff and a lot of great things together. üíôüíõ üá∫üá¶

**Mark:** We're grateful and thankful for you, Pavlo. I don't think that we could do any of this without you, man.

**Algy:** Thank you for taking the time and talking about that, Pavlo. I know it's a personal situation for you, so we appreciate the information.

**Tyler:** I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that and tack onto Pavlo, but it's real stuff. A lot of our team's families have been displaced. We have members that live in Kiev. Their apartments don't exist anymore. The Bulgarian team at Lime Chain has helped a ton of them. It hasn't only been the Universe team. Everybody is trying to help across the board, but it affects many of us. Troy's wife is Ukrainian, and her family lives in Kiev. It is a real thing that sucks, and there's no other way to put it.

**Algy:** There are 20 hours left with Ukraine NFT drop that we released. 

100% of the funds go to a source that protects innocent people impacted by this situation. We dropped the link in Pre AMA. Don't feel any pressure to donate. You can just mint or donate however much you want. We just want it to be a way for people to do it because when something happens, people ask; How can I help? We waited a little bit to decide the best place for the funds to go before we finally decided. 

**Tyler:** It went to the link that Vitalik Buterin verified and debugged and looked at it. Then even before the drop, Vitalk's Dad, Dima Buterin, was working with us and helping to make sure that it was a verified link, that it was going to a good place. I trust Vitalik more than I trust myself to know that money went into a good place. So we trusted Vitalik, and it went to the addresses he posted.

**Mark:** If anyone wants to donate, the link was shared by Tyler and the Pre AMA channel. 

Please don't feel obligated to donate, but every dollar counts, and it's all going to a good cause and helping local Ukrainians. So we'll just hop back into the AMA. 

Thank you, Pavlo, for coming up and talking about that. üíôüíõ

### **Question: Goblin**

How will some of these American DJs in the contributor lists contribute to the project? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think all of us could add to this. [Justin 3Lau](https://twitter.com/3LAU) has worked with us, and the auction house built was out of a whole style drop that he did. We just tried to make it decentralized and better for him and other artists to get the opportunity to be able to release their work and test the market. Tyler and Tim talked to these guys and are working with [Dillon Francis](https://twitter.com/DillonFrancis) on some stuff. Tim talks with Musicians and Artists from all around the World. So we even have ideas like Nick and RAC have these NFT playlists on Spotify. We could always one day create a music festival for Universe. The musicians are people who care about how the money is handled and care about NFT royalties. This is the stuff that Tim has worked on with the musicians, who are contributors and close to us. It opens up a lot of opportunities when you're working with people in the industry.

A year ago, not many people knew how NFTs were going to affect music. People like Justin 3Lau know how NFTs can affect music. So when you can hop in on the gigabrain side of music and have Justin, who understands technology, finance and NFT‚Äî and how NFTs could be utilized from an industry standpoint, those people contribute. They have a massive user base and have fans, and these guys know what they're talking about. They care more about the Artists and, How do we handle music Id? How do we handle this? How do we handle that? I think that's where they come into help. I'm sure they'll promote their drops and auctions on Universe, but we have people in the industry who are helping us move towards a better end goal. 

Why does the music industry need NFTs? Or why does Hollywood need NFTS? Or How could Hollywood or How could the music industry utilize these things? So I don't think anyone has the right answers, but I think a lot of those guys on our contributor's list have at least really good questions and some decent answers that can get the conversation going to get some really good ideas on the table.

Next question, we'll skip over Danny's question because Pavlo said how the Ukraine team is doing. But Danny, we appreciate the concern, and we appreciate you. 

### **Question: Xurkiz**

Can you explain the decentralized part of XYZ with regards to the liquidity layer and access and the website?

#### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** That's a long question. 

The decentralized part of XYZ is that we have to go through a DAO vote even to get the thing launched. We also can't limit who can access it. The website has to run on a centralized component‚Äî in terms of the website. People have not figured out how to decentralize the compute layer. I know people have bags of promising projects, but we've looked into many of these technologies. The way we built it is so that anybody can build a website into Universe. I've recently put a lot of thought into how we extrapolate this longer term. I think it's a good idea that when we do drops, like some of the ones that I'm working on right now, we start to templatize how you can plug these things into Universe. We're not going to be doing that out of the gate. We're not going to be dropping it with many Shopify-like templates. But I think that realistically if we can enable Artists to build websites on top of Universe into Universe and even work with groups, part of our go-to-market strategy will be to work with groups that want their own Marketplace but are concerned with building up liquidity on them.

Our website will be centralized, which means that if we get a DCMA, we will have to comply with it. So at scale, Universe is going to be extremely successful. If there are hundreds of Marketplaces building on top of Universe, we may be considered the central hub of a decentralized hub. Meaning we may sit in the middle, and most people go there. We may not be the biggest thing built on-top of Universe, correct? 

There may be even bigger ones than us that plugin on top of us. Our actual website, whoever is running that AWS, has to adhere to the things on there. At the liquidity level, though, it is a decentralized protocol. You would have to go through a DAO vote to make major changes to the protocol. That is how the decentralized aspect works. There's no way that we can limit anyone from plugging into the system. We can limit who can access our website. So we will have to comply with things like the OFAC. We have to comply with DCMA.

**Mark:** We've talked about it. We will comply, but anyone can build to that liquidity layer. üîë

We can't shut down the protocol. We got to protect ourselves to an extent as well. 

We're out of questions. So if anyone wants to ask any questions, now is your time. Or if you want to unmute. Some people are muted just because you had some feedback. You all can come up and ask, or we can end this when POAP. Let's ask Zach. 

Zach, did we make a POAP for this AMA?

**Algy:** We don't do them every week. You guys got to be tuning in to get the POAPS. You can't just think we will be giving you one every week. If you're joining and paying attention then you'll get one.

The POAP is a pop quiz, but instead of us giving you a test, we just give you a cool NFT for you to keep.

**Tyler:** You have to know what it stands for; **Proof of Attendance Protocol**.

**Mark:** Thank you, everybody. We appreciate you all for joining. We'll add this call to YouTube. 

Thank you, everybody. Bye. üëã
