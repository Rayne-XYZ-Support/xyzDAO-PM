## Intro

**Mark:** So today will be different because we don't have much of an agenda for everybody. We're pretty close to the ending stages, and we're just wrapping up some stuff. We're just going to open it up to the community for questions. Hopefully, the Marketplace is out next week to get that out to everybody. So we don't have any massive updates for anybody.

## Update

**Tyler:** I guess one update before we jump in is, and I want to be clear about it. We still have to put this through a DAO vote when we say that we're launching or releasing. We're working on the final stages, and every day we get closer. I've seen people posting that on March 5, and I want to clarify that my idea of launching is different from everyone else's because this is a DAO. The DAO has launched the protocol. So if it gets delayed in any capacity, it's not going to get delayed substantially past March 5. We're testing everything iteratively; it has warm-up stages. When a DAO vote happens, then there's execution. So we're not just going to launch these contracts, which is the point of everybody having tokens.

## Pre AMA Questions ?

**Mark:** I am looking for new questions that we didn't answer. We don't have too many questions. So if anybody has questions, they can come up and ask them directly, or you can type them in the Pre AMA channel.

### **Question:**

It looks like the first question we have from TaeKwonKrypto; Will 1155 be available? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think Ryan is the best person to answer that question.

**Tyler:** Ryan may be on a call. 

**Ryan:** Sorry, what was the question.

**Mark:** Will 1155 be available?

**Ryan:** They won't be supported in the 1st week of launch, but they are high-priority tickets in the 1st round of iterations.

**Algy:** Just to expand on that. We are aware of what the community wants as far as minting features. We want to push to get lazy minting features, ERC 1155 support, and maybe even other token standards that will allow people to have options when they're minting NFTs. Even though we only have that one feature for the 721 contracts, we'll have more features for 721 and other minting features for other token standards. 

**Tyler:** In the last AMA, we talked about how we had to pull things out for launch that were already far along in the pipeline. Even auctions themselves; we stopped talking about that. We have added code and work that we've done that got pulled out for the testing. I don't want to call it a beta release, and it still is an alpha release. It will work from here because we'll ultimately be working off of 2-week sprints. Everything up to this point was just a prolonged to get this out. Now we can prioritize features that need to be in every sprint. That doesn't mean that we're releasing an incomplete product. It means that every product is incomplete, and you continue to iterate and add on it. There's a rapid iteration that's going to come between launch and subsequent sprints.

## **Question:**

TaeKwonKrypto's second question was; Is there an easy button to list 250 copies of this X price NFT, or do I have to list 1 NFT for this price 250 times? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Short answer is yes. We are looking at batching and batch listing functions. More things will come in one of those 2nd iterations Chuba talked about; we are definitely looking into this stuff and have been building this. It's not one of the V1 versions of something that we will release. I don't think anyone mentioned that ERC 721 is still the premier NFT; 1155 has the use cases they're good for.

**Ryan:** They're common enough that we will support them very quickly. We have already tested it on the Marketplace regarding the question of being able to list multiple in 1 transaction or 1 per order. You will be able to do that when they go live. It's just that some things that Tyler said had to be gutted so that we can get the V1 chipped as quickly as possible.

**Mark:** Most of that was focused towards ERC 721, but we are very interested in other token standards. There are different ones that people are experimenting with it. 1155 is one of those massive use cases that people like to mint. So we are going to support those. Thank you, TaeKwonKrypto. Those are good questions.  

### **Question:**

anims515 asks; How will we connect to the Marketplace? Will Universe XYZ turn into the new homepage? Does being on the protocol level mean that there will be an app. Universe like Uniswap?

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** If you go to the New Universe site once the Marketplace is launched. There will be a button and drop down, much like all of the other drops. There's a minting button. There'll be an NFT Marketplace button where you can search for collections that you're interested in trading. You can browse the NFTs that are for sale. Then you can already see your NFTs page, and you will be able to list them for sale there. It's not going to be a new app. It'll be integrated into the main site that everyone's already used to having.

**Mark:** It'll be on mainly the same domain. 

**Ryan:** Let me add one thing because we plan to support Gem and Genie. Not immediately at launch, but very quickly after. You will be able to trade Universe listed NFTS on those platforms. Like all the aggregators, that's an integration that we very much want to prioritize.

**Mark:** I think people would be interested in that.

**Tyler:** Just that question in general, the website is easier to change than the application itself. We probably should think more about the website itself and push more to the Marketplace. We haven't had that conversation yet. Most people are going to be posting the Marketplace in social forums. If we decide that people are going to Universe.XYZ doesn't realize it has a Marketplace; we can always change that later. Let's make it a problem when it is one, but the website itself is pretty easy to change.

**Ryan:** If we want the home page to show off all the NFTs and merge with the browse page, these are all options on the table, snapshot; that's an excellent place to put things like that through initially. We're open to anything like that for sure.

**Tyler:** Not before.

**Ryan:** Please.

**Tyler:** I'm not even talking about front-end UI features. I'm talking about the website itself, and the website points to an application.

### **Question:**

Lookatmecrypto or lookatme has a question; Are the Lobby Lobsters NFTs any good for upcoming projects like Whitelist, etc? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Right now, we don't have any plans. There is one that Lobby Lobsters will be able to mint the coldest drop NFT collection. They're a group of our partners we've been working with for the last few years, and they are building a pretty sick game. I probably shouldn't talk too much about it, but the Lobby Lobsters will be a whitelist opportunity for the coldest drop. We are focused on getting Polymorphs and Lobby Lobsters on more whitelists from a developmental perspective. Currently, Zoo DAO is releasing some contracts where you'll be able to stake NFTs and battle them. Lobby Lobsters will be on that. We're also talking to the Worldwide Web about getting the Polymorphs and Lobby Lobsters on there. We will continue to work on whitelists and opportunities for holders of the Lobby Lobsters. This past month we have been extremely focused on the Marketplace, and that's our main focus. But as we get a little more free time, we will be trying to expand to more projects. Some projects have just been willingly listing the Lobby Lobsters because they think that the Lobby Lobsters were sick, community-driven drop.

**Algy:** Always remember that they exist because we have to donate to a cause. We will probably get everyone's opinion soon on what the next donation will go to. As far as the funds from the resales, there are still news articles posted pretty frequently. Long after, we initially released and explained to people what we did with the NFTs to make a raise for a good cause.

**Tyler:** It inspired other raises. The larger raise came out of Ukraine. Our Ukrainian team did a Ukraine drop, but it was the day after the much larger Ukraine drop that was with the Pleasr DAO folks.

I would look at it in 2 ways. Lobby Lobsters, we donated the funds that were raised. We were super communicative about what we were doing with them. So in the two lights, Tyler as someone that works directly on Universe, and then Tyler is a Universe community member. I have lots of Lobby Lobsters, and as a community member and things that I work on, I'm going to want to include them in those.  

We shied away from doing NFT drops because we're ultimately working on the Marketplace. We do have NFT drops planned. We're working on a lot of stuff in that capacity, and we're not going to turn our backs on Lobby Lobsters even as community members of Lobby Lobsters. They're creative commons, and we can build them into whatever we want to because we're passionate about them. The ongoing funds from Lobby Lobsters secondary also are going to lobbying efforts. What Lobby Lobsters truly was a framework for doing more honourable causes. I think that the entire industry is starting to see people arguing about it. People are basically saying that people weren't donating to Ukraine until there was extractable value. I'm afraid I have to disagree with that because there was a lot of money donated before that. I believe in allowing people to direct funds towards causes. I 100% believe that Lobby Lobsters kicked that off and will continue to be pioneers. The actual Lobby Lobsters don't have any type of budget. If it was a rug, it was a rug that we all agreed to do and to give the funds to lobbying efforts. Those lobbying efforts are ongoing.

We gave more money to it, and it was multiple years of runway for the organization we donated to. It was more money than they've ever had donated to them in their entire budget. Those people are in Washington fighting for Crypto. You guys can follow that group Coin Center and Neeraj, and they're constantly talking about the conversations that they're having. So the Lobby Lobsters are helping. We get these questions all the time. I always feel like people are asking us to defend the price, which we're not going to do, or to say that there's going to be this ongoing committed development from some team that we raise capital off of and are compensating, and that's not the case. We told everybody that we were given the funds. That's what we did with the funds, and we all agreed to that. As a community member, wanting to build stuff into them is very different from the Barnbridge team. We're also not stopping any community members from wanting to do cool stuff with Lobby Lobsters. 

**Nick:** We have a polymorph team, but we do not have a Lobby Lobsters team, but we will continue to add them to stuff when we're able to. It's convenient for the community. But what we're trying to say is we're not going to go out of our way to build cool titles.

**Algy:** Specifically, what Nick is saying. Anything that happens will be through a DAO vote.

**Mark:** After this conversation, I wanted to shout out because we put together that Ukraine drop, but it wasn't us. It was the Ukrainian team that worked for us. Pablo is in here. Pablo wants to come up and say anything about the Ukraine drop. I think it would be better. Pablo, do you want to come up.

**Tyler:** Pablo may also help because the more important question they ask is how the Ukrainian team is doing. I feel like you should be the one to answer that. I can answer it for you if you don't want to talk.

**Pablo:** I can. Do you hear me, guys?

**Ryan:** Yes, we can hear you.

**Pablo:** Hi, everyone. I joined late, but I heard the question, so I think I can answer that. Ukraine is going through hard times right now. I'm not going to dive much into politics, but it's just a matter of it's a real war, missile strikes, and just people are suffering, especially civilians. It hasn't been safe for them in those parts of Ukraine where all of this is actually happening. We've been trying to help them move to safe places as much as possible. I am safe right now. For this job, though, we try to make this stand with Ukraine. NFT dropped for the Ukrainian Army and the Ukrainian people because the Ukrainian Army is the guys protecting the civilians right now. So we self-organized over the weekend. We had pure support from everyone from the Universe team. We organized this drop, and it's available by the links done with the Ukraine community. It was organized for 72 hours, and the minting is going to be available for another 19 hours. If you haven't checked that, feel free to. But we got a bunch of funds collected, and I want to say I really appreciate all of your guy's support. It's really what the people of Ukraine need right now because it's not that easy. So I do appreciate that. Thank you for all your support during these days. I'm just grateful and excited to be a part of this community. I think that going forward, and we'll be able to do great stuff and a lot of great things together.

**Mark:** We're grateful and thankful for you, Pablo. I don't think that we could do any of this without you, man.

**Algy:** Thank you for taking the time and talking about that, Pablo. I know it's a personal situation for you, so we appreciate the information.

**Tyler:** I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that and tack onto Pablo, but it's real stuff. A lot of our team's families have been displaced. We have members that live in Car KIEV. Their apartments don't exist anymore. The Bulgarian team at Lime Chain has helped a ton of them. It hasn't just been the Universe team. Everybody is trying to help across the board, but it affects many of us. Troy's wife is Ukrainian, and her family lives in Kiev. It is a real thing that sucks, and there's no other way to put it.

**Algy:** There are 20 hours left with Ukraine NFT drop that we released 100% of the funds go to a source that protects innocent people impacted by this situation. So we dropped the link in Pre AMA. Don't feel any pressure to donate. You can just mint or donate however much you want. We just want it to be a way for people to do it because when something happens, people ask; How can I help? We waited a little bit to decide the best place for the funds to go before we finally decided. 

**Tyler:** It went to the link that Vitalik Buterin verified and debugged and looked at it. Then even before the drop, Vitalk's Dad, Dima Buterin, was working with us and helping to make sure that it was a verified link, that it was going to a good place. I trust Vitalik more than I trust myself to know that money went into a good place. So we trusted Vitalik, and it went to the addresses he posted.

**Mark:** If anyone wants to donate, the link was just shared by Tyler and the Pre AMA channel. Please don't feel obligated to donate, but every dollar counts, and it's all going to a good cause and helping local Ukrainians. So we'll just hop back into the AMA. Thank you, Pablo, for coming up and talking about that. 

### **Question:**

So we'll jump into AJ Skiller's question; How will some of these American DJs in the contributor lists contribute to the project? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think all of us could add to this. Justin 3Lau has worked with us, and the auction house built was out of a whole style drop that he did. We just tried to make it decentralized and better for him and other Artists to get the opportunity to be able to release their work and test the market. Tyler and Tim talked to these guys and are working with Dylan Francis on some stuff. Tim talks with Musicians and Artists from all around the World. So we even have ideas like Nick and RAC have these NFT playlists on Spotify. We could always one day create a music festival for Universe. The musicians are people who care about how the money is handled and care about NFT royalties. This is the stuff that Tim has worked on with the musicians, who are contributors and close to us. It opens up a lot of opportunities when you're working with people in the industry.

A year ago, not many people knew how NFTs were going to affect music. People like Justin 3Lau know how NFTs can affect music. So when you can hop in on the gigabrain side of music and have Justin, who understands technology and finance and NFT and how NFTs could be utilized from an industry standpoint, those people contribute. They have a massive user base and have fans, and these guys know what they're talking about. They care more about the artists and, How do we handle music Id? How do we handle this? How do we handle that? I think that's where they come into help. I'm sure they'll promote their drops and auctions on Universe, but we have people in the industry who are helping us move towards a better end goal. Why the music industry need NFTs? Or why does Hollywood need NFTS? Or How could Hollywood or How could the music industry utilize these things? So I don't think anyone has the right answers, but I think a lot of those guys on our contributor's list have at least really good questions and some decent answers that can get the conversation going to get some really good ideas on the table.

Next question, we'll skip over Danny's question because Pablo said how the Ukraine team is doing. But Danny, we appreciate the concern, and we appreciate you. 

### **Question:**

It looks like Zurkis has a question; Can you explain the decentralized part of XYZ with regards to the liquidity layer and access and the website?

#### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** That's a long question. The decentralized part of XYZ is that we have to go through a DAO vote even to get the thing launched. We also can't limit who can access it. The website has to run on a centralized component ultimately in terms of the website. People have not figured out how to decentralize the compute layer. I know people have bags of promising projects, but we've looked into many of these technologies. Ultimately, the way we built it is so that anybody can build a website into Universe. I've recently put a lot of thought into how we extrapolate this longer term. I think it's a good idea that when we do drops, like some of the ones that I'm working on right now, we start to templatize how you can plug these things into Universe. We're not going to be doing that out of the gate. We're not going to be dropping it with many Shopify-like templates. But I think that realistically if we can enable artists to build websites on top of Universe into Universe and even work with groups, part of our go-to-market strategy will be to work with groups that want their own Marketplace but are concerned with building up liquidity on them.

Our website will be centralized, which means that if we get a DCMA, we will have to comply with it. So at scale, Universe is going to be extremely successful. If there are hundreds of Marketplaces building on top of Universe, we may be considered the central hub of a decentralized hub. Meaning we may sit in the middle, and most people go there. We may not, correct? There may be even bigger ones than us that plugin on top of us. Our actual website, whoever is running that AWS, has to adhere to the things on there. At the liquidity level, though, it is a decentralized protocol. You would have to go through a DAO vote to make major changes to the protocol. That is how the decentralization of it works. There's no way that we can limit anyone from plugging into the system. We can limit who can access our website. So we will have to comply with things like the OFAC. We have to comply with DCMA.

**Mark:** We've talked about it. We will comply, but anyone can build to that liquidity layer. We can't shut down the protocol. We got to protect ourselves to an extent as well. We're out of questions. So if anyone wants to ask any questions, now is your time. Or if you want to unmute. Some people are muted just because you had some feedback. You all can come up and ask, or we can end this when POAP. Let's ask Zach. Zach, did we make a POAP for this AMA.

**Algy:** But we don't do them every week. You guys got to be tuning in to get the POAPS. You can't just think we will be giving you one every week. If you're joining and paying attention? 

The POAP is a pop quiz, but instead of us giving you a test, we just give you a cool NFT for you to keep.

**Tyler:** If you can't say it right, you have to know what it stands for the whole meeting proof of attendance protocol.

**Mark:** Thank you, everybody. We appreciate you all for joining. We'll add this call to YouTube. Thank you, everybody. Bye.

### Breakdown:

Moderator: Mark Ward

Scribe: Tammy M.

Attendees: Mark Ward, Tyler Ward, Tim Kang, Troy Murray, Ryan Shtirmer, Dragos Rizescu, Cezar Paraschiv, Pavlo Bendus, Dmytro Dutka, Ilia Andreev, Zhivko Todorov, Stanislav Trenev, Andon Mitev, Algernon (Young Algy), Nick Ward

## Intro

## Marketplace Update

**Mark:** The main update in the Marketplace is coming in the next few days. We will try our best to deploy the contracts and then create a DAO vote to launch the protocol. Our goal is to do that within the next few days. I'm not going to give an exact date. 

**Tyler:** We are going to try for Friday.

**Troy:** Let me put it this way. We are forming the proposal right now, and we plan on putting it in on Friday. So we're there, people.

 ## Pre AMA Question ?

### **Question:**

We're going to jump right into the first question, resistance; What if someone plugs into Universe and makes a Marketplace on their website? Will Universe get a portion of the fees from the trades there?

#### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** Yes

**Troy:** Yes

**Mark:** Yes

**Troy:** There will be a front end that has the ability to plug in and use it, and there will be a finder's fee, and the front end will be able to keep it. The main protocol itself, which is the DAO, which is Universe, will get a cut. So it's being designed to incentivize other front ends to use the back end and our Marketplace so they can be sustainable, but it also sustains the protocol.

**Mark:** So I think that answers that. 

### **Question:** 

The next question is; When to vote? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Hopefully, Friday, if all goes to plan.

**Troy:** There's a warm-up period. On Friday, everyone will have a couple of days to stake their XYZ. If you don't have a stake once that warm-up period is done, there will be a snapshot and whoever was staked during that warm-up period. You will then be able to vote. It will start Sunday, or it's going to start Monday. I don't fully remember right now. You will have four days to vote so that you have ample time. Just make sure you're staked during the warm-up period. You will have this weekend to get in. We don't see any reason not to put the proposal in on Friday unless something catastrophic occurs, which I don't foresee happening.

**Mark:** I went and read ahead, Troy, I think these next few questions might be best for you to answer, or you can decide what to answer. 

### **Question:**

But Chad has a series of questions; The first one is, Why must we vote on a proposal that would never be voted against? Is it only for legal reasons that the team distributes responsibility and aligning incentives? I guess that's the first question.

#### **Answer:**

**Troy:** I can answer that. It's a bit of both, but it's better if a community wants to launch something like this. It's better to show that the whole community is activating it so everyone can share in that. Obviously, there's some legal stuff around that, too. I'm surprised more DAOs don't do it that way.

**Mark:** Tyler had a few talks with other Founders in the industry, and they had also recommended that we do it this way. Chad had some other questions.

**Tyler:** I thought we should have minted the minting contracts through that. But the exchange of NFTs themselves is an NFT exchange, and it's run by the DAO; it should be activated by DAO. We probably should have gone through that process for the minting.

**Trevor:** You can see some information about our minting and Marketplace and our Auctions in our white paper. 

**Mark:** Chad, the answer to these other questions is that I think this came up within the last month and a half, and we decided to do it this way.

**Tyler:** We decided that we should go through the process on the finish line. I think that we all agreed that it was the right move. That week will be excellent for us to deal with kinks. It is done and are going through the DAO vote process.

**Trevor:** The community is going to be able to audit the contracts when the DAO proposal is launched. The contracts will be in place, and the DAO proposal is specified that the DAO is the owner of these contracts. So this will allow the community to review our work. If something is wrong, we can always not pass the vote or abrogate the vote. We can always iterate if something's wrong. I don't expect that will happen, but it gives the community the chance to review our work, review the smart contracts, and make sure that everything is 100% solid before it actually goes live.

**Mark:** That's an extremely good point, too. 

### **Question:**

James asked a question; What were some of the Kinks holding up a launch? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We have just had some issues with our back-end Scraper. It was testing and fixing things when you're building something like this. It seems like once you fix something, another thing breaks.

**Tyler:** You're also launching a large piece of software.

**Troy:** This is a full-on application that had to be worked out. This isn't just launching smart contracts into the network that are going to run. There's a software application behind the whole thing. Working through those kinks and edge cases takes a while because it's not simple; it's not just running computations on Ethereum. It's a very sophisticated application that takes time, and we've all learned that the hard way.

**Trevor:** The Data Scraper is very complex. It consists of 10-12 microservicesâ€”multiple replicas of each of those microservices that analyze the entire blockchain. Every NFT and every transaction that the NFT has ever been a part of. So it's not just the wallets connected to Universe; it's the entire blockchain. We've gone through many iterations of improving this. One example: We are now looking for an improvement where the Scraper runs forward and backward in time. So that we can give it a star block, which is a recent block, and it monitors all the recent transactions. Then it also goes backwards in time to get all of the most recent transactions first, as opposed to starting three years in the past and going forward from there. There are a lot of very complex parts to this project, and I'm confident that it will be perfect by the time we release it to the public.

### **Question:**

James F's next question was; Why is the XYZ price bot gone? Any reason for that? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** It's just in the Universe dash. It's not under crypto price bots. So the crypto price bots are ETH and Bitcoin, and then you have the XYZ price bot right above in the Universe dash. 

**Add Speaker:** I was just saying. Yeah, it's back now, but it was gone.

**Mark:** Okay. Maybe someone fixed it.

**Tyler:** It is a bot, so it goes down sometimes, like in fear. It can go down. 

**Troy:** Discord can go down, the botmaster. Some of those things probably had to get turned back on.

### **Question:**

Autobobro has a question; What is the decentralization model of Universe XYZ?

#### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** I don't understand that question.

**Mark:** Our model is to decentralize everything we can, look at the industry, and decentralize the centralized aspects. We will continue building and trying to decentralize everything we can around NFT. Our main goal is to centralize every aspect of this protocol.

**Trevor:** There are certain things you can't decentralize on the blockchain right now. You can't put kubernetes and a database on the blockchain. We can decentralize respect to the smart contracts with respect to the DAO proposals. But there are just certain things that still have to be on Web, too.

**Mark:** Eventually, and hopefully, there are ways to decentralize some of these things, and we'll get there, make proposals, and build towards that.

**Trevor:** As soon as the internet, computer or fleek are mature products, we will certainly be looking at deploying there. Right now, it's just not quite at that stage yet. We still need certain components that are on cloud providers. There's just no way around that right now.

### **Question:**

Chad has another question; What does the autonomous part of the DAO first governance model mean to the Universe team? In other words, how will Universe continue to remain governed with autonomy as its distribution continues?

#### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** The autonomous part is that the contracts run, and no one can turn them. We could shut down the front end that runs the DAO. The contracts run autonomously. So that word of it is saying that it can run autonomously from utilized authority.

I was just saying that the contracts run autonomously from any centralized entity. So it's a decentralized organization that runs autonomously. It doesn't need a centralized entity running autonomously as distribution continues. The point of that is that the plan for distributing more of the token is to put it in the hands of more people. Depending on what the distribution cuts ultimately look like. Fewer people can push a DAO vote forward than the POAP would. Then it becomes more and more decentralized, meaning there are more holders for voting and partaking in governance on the network. 

**Mark:** And that's the beauty of a decentralization team. AlgoMagicBeans has a question.

**Nick:** I just want to say something because I got a DM from a fake Polymorphs announcement. Where obviously not minting Polymorphs, don't click on any DMs ever. We're not going to ever DM you. Rayne and I are going to ban these people.

### **Question:**

AlgoMagicBeans question is; Are there any features that will come with the release of the Marketplace that other key competitors will not have? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think Chuba's favourite feature is that we will have an on-chain order book. I don't think that anyone in the industry has that. Chuba would be the best person to explain why that is more powerful. The way I understand it is that when you have on-chain orders, like how OpenSea has front-end hacks, it's harder, if not impossible, to hack. One of these on-chain orders is from our front end or another front end unless you interact with the contracts that are bugged.

**Trevor:** We've had the contracts written for a while on-chain orders. I don't think they will be releasing the first version of the front piece in the first sprint. I like them because other contracts can hook into them and leverage floor bids if they need a source of NFT liquidity. We'll see what kind of cool things people can do with it.

**Mark:** We will be the first decentralized protocol Marketplace. Zora is a protocol, but they are a centralized entity, and we are not. We are a DAO, and it goes back to that decentralization talk. 

### **Question:**

Today, we've had some of these questions; Why will we deploy our contracts with the DAO?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** That is how it needs to be and how it needs to be done. Hopefully, if you're listening to this conversation, you've already heard why we've been doing that. Thank you for the questions. I think that we answered the rest of this question. 

**Mark:** but we will bring bulk listings and all sorts of floor bidding and cool stuff like that. But as Chuba says, we're going to bring a lot of those things in on the 2nd iterations because the best way to scale this is not to put it all up at one time. It releases it in segments, but we have a lot of work that we've done, and we just want to release it in sections just because it's easier to maintain stuff from breaking, and you can find what happens easier. It's just a better way to do this from a development standpoint.

### **Question:**

James asked a question; the question is about Dev teamwork. 

#### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** That would be a major move towards centralization. I'm not a Dev. I don't know if Troy wants to add to what I'm about to say. I would say that we placed more trust in Dfinity working than what it probably deserved. The coming year will determine if Dfinity will quote on quote 'work'. Right now, it doesn't. I know Troy's talked to quite a bit. I have nothing but respect for Dfinity.

I wouldn't say that it works for any of the use cases we need it to right now. But what they're building is ambitious, and I respect that team and hope it will work at some point. 

**Trevor:** Yes. Agreed.

**Troy:** I would say it's probably still pretty far out, but I know they're still developing. It's entangled in internal stuff going on. So I haven't talked to them in a while, but it's on my list to reach out to them soon. There is just a bunch of other more important stuff to get done. Then we have some other solutions that we're cooking up that will help alleviate some of the stuff we are planning on Dfinity doing, so stay tuned for that.

**Mark:** We're building a lot. 

### **Question:**

ChicagoNine has one more question; I think we've answered this in the past. It goes back to the question last week about Fiat On-Ramps. Will Universe deploy to Moonbeam? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I'm pretty sure that is what OpenSea uses so that you can use a credit card. We are not planning on using any type of Fiat On-Ramp system like that for our Marketplace right now.

**Troy:** Can I jump in on that one?

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Troy:** It's tough to set up a Fiat On-Ramp with a DAO because you don't have an entity. It's completely impossible. But what we are doing is incentivizing those Marketplaces that are those front ends that attach onto our back end, and they can facilitate those types of connections. Graviton itself is an entity that could do something like that. I would say Universe won't use it, but I would expect to see other front ends to use it.

**Mark:** That's a great way to put it. That is all the questions we have asked Algo if, Dfinity ICP blockchain, and it is yes, it's a cool product. They have some cool chats over there, and they're cool people. We definitely wish them the best if nobody has any other questions.

**Tyler:** Other than that guy, James, that is a good idea once we launch the Marketplace; I think a spreadsheet with just generalized sprints is probably a good idea so that you know what features are coming. Because you're right, it will constantly result in a bunch of questions. So maybe that's something that I like.

I think that's something that we could do for the newsletter. We had plans to do a newsletter, and then our Marketplace had gotten delayed, and I think we have a lot coming out between the Polymorph. Our minting contracts are a lot. James is saying notion. Maybe a public notion would be good.

Maybe Mark and Rayne can help put something like that together. We use notion so that we will create it as a public notion. It's a good idea. We'll figure out a format that works.

**Mark:** Rayne loves that kind of stuff. Rayne was asking me about it the other day. He said something like that, but he wanted it for himself. A lot of requests have come through the support. We have been taking feature requests and putting them into our internal slack. We can create a feature request channel, but sometimes the discussions get a little bit lengthy. Then you don't know the best place to go and look for and say here's the list. We're taking the feature request through the support or how they've just been coming in. I'm sure we already have a channel about feature requests. Maybe we archived it.

**Algy:** Doing it through support tickets makes the most sense because you can save that conversation. 

**Mark:** If you look in the ideas channel right now, there are some serious dynamic royalties. These are great suggestions. I'm pretty sure we already have pretty dynamic royalties. We've been working with Tim Kang on that, and you will see that as the Marketplace launches.

**Algy:** I told our team that I agree with this point, that Rhino Zeros makes that once we have our Marketplace release, work on creating, what he's saying, a home page that just brings people straight to the Marketplace. I'm pretty sure that we already have a V2 homepage. 

**Mark:** Dima has been working on this, and I think we will be able to make that happen, but not right away when it launches. It'll come through as we scale everything and get everything attached. I don't think we have any more questions.

## Feature Set

**Trevor:** I've got a few quick notes regarding the feature set and how we compare.

**Nick:** Along with feature request stuff, I'm working a lot on putting together community checklists and guides that can be used to make your way through the ecosystem. I also want to work on standards and terms used frequently and consistently so everyone is on a similar page.

**Trevor:** I've got another couple of quick comments about feature sets and how we might compare it to competitors. Just because we're a DOA and our stuff will be open-sourced is one of the primary things. We have a non-anonymous team. If you compare us to Looks Rare, that has a completely anonymous team, that all of their stuff is completely closed source, and it also all depends on the OpenSea API, that's just weak. Our stuff doesn't depend on OpenSea at all. We have an anonymous team, and we're going to open source as much of our stuff as possible. You'll also be able to use our APIs to build your own applications. 

Then as far as specific features, I can't drop too much alpha, but we do have several killer features that are right on the horizon that nobody else in the ecosystem is doing right now. The Scraper is the boss. Nobody has a Data Scraper as advanced as ours. It's looking at the entire blockchain, every single NFT, every single transaction that's ever happened. So it's been a massive project. That in itself is one of the things that sets us apart from Looks Rare. It's just pinging the OpenSea API and pulling down the transactions for only the user that signed in.

**Mark:** Are these the docs for developers to integrate with Universe? We haven't released the docs yet to integrate with developers, and they are going to come right after we launch everything and is exactly where you will go, and yes, this is where it's going to be. We'll have how to connect to APIs and how to connect to certain things. Then we'll even add a UI tool kit so that people can take UI from Universe and add it to their front end if they want. 

**Algy:** I have a question for Zach. Honestly, do we have any updates as far as polymor floor, besides the fact that we're getting more focused on it? The community has created a lot of the lore around Clown Charles and the scrambling functions. We've been working on having more built out like lore for the Polymorphs. We'll have some updates as far as Polymorphs and what they're doing because you guys are wondering. Where are the Polymorphs, and what are they doing? 

**Mark:** The polymers are going south by southwest. We're going to FLUF World. FLUF house. 

**Algy:** There's so much fun stuff for the Polymorphs and cool stuff that we have ready for. That's why I hoped I could share a little bit of content on the Polymorph. 

**Mark:** We're not telling anybody about that. Okay, we'll talk soon, everybody. We're out of questions, and we had some really good questions. Thank you, guys. I think that led to a good discussion. Okay, thank you, Chad. We love you all. We'll see you all soonâ€”next week.

**Rayne:** I will say I recently just pushed the call notes; they've been delayed; we just did 14 to 20. Then we'll do the AMAs once we figure out the best format. Then you guys can always easily reference just all the project information that's come out over the months. There's a lot there, honestly. A lot of questions that are frequently asked are there. So I'll convert those to articles for the knowledge base, so that stuff will all be easy to find in time.

**Mark:** Zach might be lying. He might do it everywhere. He's psyops you all hard. All right, we appreciate you all, and we'll get back. Okay, guys, we love you all.
