## Intro

**Mark:** Hey everyone, welcome to Project call number 15.
 
We're super excited. We have some fantastic news for you guys today. 

## Products [[1:32]](https://youtu.be/BKVvObpaOV8?t=92)

### Minting ü•º‚öóÔ∏è 

**Mark:**  We'll go ahead and just roll into updates for the minting. We had kind of like a 2.5, 3 weeks of the beta testing period. We opened up to some contributors and many people in the discord, which was super successful. We really appreciate everyone that was involved in that. You guys have really helped us find some bugs that we could fix. So that went all according to plan and pretty rapidly for us that we felt comfortable enough to move forward. So it's looking like our Universe Minting will go live as early as next week, hopefully, Monday, if everything goes to plan. So that's super exciting. So we have almost five days, and we'll have Universe minting up for everyone to finally be able to mint. So that's super exciting. We're going to have some articles and documentation coming out on minting, so we'll have tons of FAQs. Also, we'll be releasing some medium articles, so look out for those. And those are going to really hit on points of why we did this and really how universal.


Our minting is different from a decentralization standpoint. So that everyone kind of gets that and understands. So we're super excited. We have many people anticipating this coming out, we're thrilled to have minting out and have our first product release. 


### Auctions & Marketplace üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è üñº [[02:09]](https://youtu.be/BKVvObpaOV8?t=129)

Next up is we have been working on auctions. The auctions are pretty far along. Unfortunately, they're not going to be releasing along with the minting. That was the original plan, but we've had some delays, and we just wanted to go ahead and push out the minting first, so we can get something to market. But the auction should be coming pretty soon afterwards. I don't have any solid timelines on that, but hopefully, it's coming. It's looking like, at least in the next 4 weeks, we should for sure have something out along the lines of auctions. If not, we'll be really close. So we still have a few things to do with that. We have a test environment, but we haven't opened it up to beta testing or anybody, but we will go through that process again.

We may not open it up to as many beta testers, but we do really appreciate our beta testers. They really did help us a lot. And the more eyes you can get on some of this stuff, it really does help because when you've been looking at things for months and months and months and reviewing and reviewing, you tend to miss small little things where new eyes tend to catch them up pretty quickly. So that really helps us. And we do just want to say how thankful we are for all of you guys who help with that. So really, the main thing we've been getting a lot of questions around is the marketplace. It seems like everyone is very eager to see that and get that out. We've seen a lot of marketplaces emerge. We're still head down building. We have tunnel vision of what we're doing. We want to build our products and get them out ASAP. But we also don't want to get distracted by anything. Also, we have faith that the product that we're pushing to market is going to be different than some of these other marketplaces that you guys see, definitely because we're focusing more on the decentralized angle and decentralized technology.

Whereas I don't think some teams and communities genuinely understand what it takes to decentralize an NFT or decentralize NFT. That's some of the stuff that will be hit on and mentioned in some of these medium articles. Documentation is really like the why we did this and why we think NFT needs to be decentralized, other than just being decentralized. We always say decentralization, but there are significant reasons people stress decentralization in this industry. We'll head on a lot of those points in the Medium article. So just keep a lookout for that. 

The closer we get to releasing all these products, the more articles and documentation and FAQs that we will set up. Also, we'd like to mention that we will have a full-on support desk for our minting, auctions, and marketplace. OpenSea and Rarible, and other marketplaces in the industry do have support desks. I personally don't use the support desks, but we have been looking into them, and they seem very useful for community members. So we want to make sure that we have all the proper documentation and excellent support teams and desks in place for the community to have all the resources they need. ([Official Universe Support Server](https://discord.gg/MNmwfB2sxD))

### Resources for Users of Universe XYZ

* [Knowledge base](https://universe.freshdesk.com/support/solutions)
* [Universe Basics](https://docs.universe.xyz/universe-basics)
* [Universe XYZ‚Äî Beginner's Guide to Governance](https://docs.universe.xyz/beginners-guide-to-governance)
* [Whitepaper](https://github.com/UniverseXYZ/UniverseXYZ-Whitepaper)

So, that's super exciting. That's something that we've been working on for the last few months. We've actually been hiring people from the community to help with that. Someone that we hired is named: [Knowledgeable Idiot](https://twitter.com/raynemang). He's truly been working with us from the early stages of [Barnbridge](https://barnbridge.com). He was one of our first participants in the bounty program. He also came over from Universe to help with a few bounties, like taking notes with project calls. But he was working in a support desk for another NFT marketplace, and he has been a ton of help in helping us sculpt out how this support desk will work and how it's going to really help everyone. Hopefully, we have the best support team in the industry. 

I personally think that a good support team is critical. What would you say is a good added bonus to an incredible marketplace. I wanted to go over that. We're not going to throw you guys into a marketplace and not have any support or proper documentation. We'll have videos on how to mint, we'll have videos on how to post an auction. We'll have videos on how to list an NFT.

> [Minting FAQs](https://docs.universe.xyz/universe-basics/minting-faqs).

So anything that you can do, we're going to have either a video or step-by-step instructions of what you need to do or any questions you may run into during the process. All in our Gitbooks so that everyone has all the information they need. Those are all of our product updates. 

Right now, we have a few more minor updates. 

## Polymorph Leek ü¶πüö∞

I can give you guys some of our updates on the side of Polymorphs. This isn't on the agenda, but right now, our Polymorph, we have a few contracts that we've been working on. The battle games, the Polymorph Bridge. LimeChain is working on their own game called MorphLand. But the Battle Morph game has passed audits, and the front end is pretty close to going. We're just waiting on the V2‚Äî Polygon Bridge ‚Äîto finish the audit. This will allow us to push the game out and have everything we need to turn the scrambling back on. And so that the polymorphs will be able to be used in the game and be scrambled on Polygon and do everything that we said they were going to be able to do.

So we'll have fewer scrambling. That's the main thing. And you'll be able to have the choice to bridge the Polygon or not; that's up to you. When you bridge over to Polygon, and you scramble for nearly-free. Scrambling will take place on Polygon and if it's scrambled it scrambles on ETH mainnet too. That's part of why we started on ETH with the Polymorphs. 

This allows us to build forward a little more seamlessly and enables us to go to an L2 with features like scrambling. The asset will change on both blockchains. (The metadata is transferred) 

We're really excited about that. The team is pumped to get the scrambling back on. 

We apologize for taking so long, but we needed to shut down the contracts while editing them. It's just proper practice to do that. This way, there are no exploits or bugs that appear while we're working on them. Okay, so those are the updates for everything. 

Polymorphs, Marketplace, Auctions, Minting. ‚úåÔ∏è


## NFT NYC üåÉ üñº [[10:41]](https://youtu.be/BKVvObpaOV8?t=641)

**Mark:** We are 2 weeks out or not even 12 days. We are, as you all may know, throwing a pretty big party in NYC for NFT-NYC.

We actually have had information finally get posted to come out and say everything about the party posted and shared. So our official partner for this party is Monstercat, and the name of the event is actually going to be Universal Poetry. And the exciting thing about this is we actually have opened up the tickets to more NFT groups. So initially, it was just the Polymorphs that was an entry ticket. Still, we're opening that up to the Lobby Lobsters and Pak Lost Poets, which is a fantastic community, and we are excited to align ourselves with them. And honestly, we are super happy to have a PAK on anything Universe. So this was a super unexpected surprise for most people. Many people are super excited that we have a few names like [PAK](https://twitter.com/muratpak) coming and doing galleries. And not to mention we're also going to have galleries and some curated art from [TooMuchLag](https://twitter.com/toomuchlag), [Ness Graphics](https://twitter.com/Ness_Graphics) and [Jack Butcher](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher). So we have a vast lineup of highly talented artists. We're going to have great communities aligned and all together in a sick venue.

The venue is [Hammerstein Ballroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerstein_Ballroom). It's like a world-famous venue. My fiance was like, oh my God, Hammerstein Ballroom. How do you even know what that is? But apparently, it's world-famous, and I didn't even know. So we have the top-of-the-line venue. It's going to be from 8:00 p.m. To 12:00 a.m. November 2, and we're going to have some sick live performances from music artists Cascade, Destruction, Haywire and [Destructo](https://twitter.com/destructoamf) as well. 

Honestly, I think [Tim](https://twitter.com/illestrater_) and [MonsterCat](https://twitter.com/Monstercat) are the people involved in this. I want to say mad kudos‚Äî pats on the back. Tyler did a lot to help with this as well. I know that some team members had pulled some funds out of their own pockets to make this happen. Not to mention the DAO voted to pay for the majority of this. So this is definitely something that the community is excited for and wants.

We're really excited to share this experience with you guys. We definitely need to give props to Tim, Tyler and Team, and [MonsterCat](https://www.monstercat.com/) for getting these lineups. I think this will be one of the best events in NFT-NYC this year, and hopefully, this is the party that people are talking about; that's like, hey man, were you there at the Universe MonsterCat party? That's really what we want to do is build a memorable experience to really remember this badass year that we've all had together, which is the year of NFT. We're just really excited to launch our marketplace and have this kind of be our kick-off party and have us say, hey, we're here, and we're ready to kick this off and get started, and we're here to stay.

The team is happy that we have artists like PAK, Jack Butcher, Ness Graphics, and TooMuchLag interested. Those types of people with their level of following coming and saying they want to be a part of the Universe‚Äî while also wanting to be a part of our parties. I personally think it's an excellent feeling that people in the space have as much respect as PAK and are interested in what we're doing at Universe.

And I think that speaks large sums about what we're genuinely, honestly trying to do with decentralizing NFTs and decentralizing an NFT marketplace and bringing those social features to Marketplaces so that we can all truly enjoy and share and talk about it. We've always said NFTs are so social in nature. So these social parties and social aspects of NFTs are really, I think they will be very, very big over the next few years where we see communities come together. You have proof of access or attendance and all these extraordinary tech use cases for NFTs. I just think we're going to see a lot of fantastic exploration of this technology and even NFT-NYC; your ticket is NFT. Basically, you use a polymorph, a lost poet, or a lobby lobster as your NFT. You use that NFT to be able to buy a ticket. I believe some of the tickets will be NFTs, and I think some of them will be email confirmations. I can figure out more about that and maybe tweet about it or drop some info in the discord. But we actually have a link.

I'm going to add it into the YouTube video in the comments, and it's also in the agenda, [www.ticketfairy.com](https://www.ticketfairy.com) So just look out for that link on our flyer, and we have our flyer going around on Twitter. So retweet it, like it, and share it with your friends. And one big important thing is a new note. I believe that every ticket has a plus one for the NFT. So I think that if you go on there, I just bought a Universe and I bought my tickets, but they're free because I have a polymorph, but it allowed me to get two. And I only have one Polymorph in that wallet. So I think the extra one is for your plus one. And then you have to make the reservation in that person's name that whoever your plus one is that you're going to bring. So that's super exciting. So you can get a friend if you have Kawaii or something or like an NFT friend you want to bring along; that's now a possibility. I think many other people will be excited to hear they can get a friend.

So if you have a friend with you at NFT-NYC and you have a part, and you have a ticket, maybe sign them up, bring them along, and introduce them to us all. We'll be excited to meet everyone. 

## Yield Farming üöú üåæ [[18:53]](https://youtu.be/BKVvObpaOV8?t=1133)

One last thing and this is a big one. We really want to say thank you to everyone. Our yield farming has just come to a close to 20 weeks, and I honestly can't believe it. This is project call number 15. We've been doing these project calls since I want to say April, and it's just crazy to me that it's moving so fast. So you just want to come back and thank everyone for participating in the yield farming. I think at peak, we had about $260,000,000 in yield farming. Total value locked, which is incredible. The Aave community had at one point $40 million in the farm. So it's just been really sweet to see communities like Chainlink, Aave, Compound Finance and SNX alls align themselves with Universe. Even the [Illuvium](https://www.illuvium.io/) guys doing the flash pools and giving XYZ some opportunity to farm Illuvium back. We just want to say thank you to everyone involved in all these farming pools.

We can't do it without the other teams. We thought it was cool that Illuvium had opened up that flash pool afterwards to allow some XYZ token holders to get some Illuvium because Illuvium had been out for a while. So that's just a tremendous move from them; hey, we want you guys to also be a part of our community. That was a few weeks ago, but we have some more opportunities to do some yield farming right now. Currently, you can take your XYZ, and you can farm League tokens from [League DAO](https://leaguedao.com/), and also you can farm enter tokens with [Enter DAO](https://enterdao.xyz/). 

Not to mention there's the [DAO that anyone can go and stake their XYZ](https://dao.universe.xyz/governance/overview) in. Also, the DAO is vital if anyone is interested in governance or really being active in the community. The best and easiest way for anyone to engage the community is to follow up with any proposals in discord. Or snapshot votes or anything like that that we're doing. Those are all basically governance things we use. If you want to participate in governance now that you're not farming or don't really know what to do, the more products that we come out and the more things that we push out, the more proposals, the more governance activity we're going to have.

The best way to participate in that is to have your token staked in the DAO and participate in voting. So I personally think that's very important. I'm probably going to be stressing that a little bit more to some of the NFT newbies that I see in the discords. I just think that there are not enough people in the NFT space to honestly, I think, get the whole governance thing and why we do it this way. I encourage everyone to learn about governance if you aren't already because this is truly why this goes back to that decentralization. 

We can make decentralized decisions as a community through that voting. And that's extremely powerful when you think about it, comparing it to an OpenSea, whereas we all see the Twitter feedback to OpenSea. It's like, hey, please add this feature, and who knows where that goes? But in theory, with Universe. We could add this feature. You don't agree with me? Well, I'm going to put in a proposal, and we're going to see what the community agrees. So that is, I think, extremely powerful. And we've witnessed governance be super successful before in DeFi.

We personally think it will be super successful in NFTs as well. That's really why we've made this approach and why we encourage everyone to participate in those DAO activities and governance activities. And if you have questions about governance or anything, always feel free to ask the team or community about it in the discord and just try to stay. And that's just the top way to be involved. Everyone asked me, Hey, how can I be involved? And really, the primary way to be involved is to participate in governance. We haven't had a ton of governance votes.

**Tyler:** We don't have a lot of products yet, right? I mean, we've got polymorphs and a few things, but I think the expectation should be that governance will naturally pick up and start to decentralize when there's a protocol live.

**Mark:** We'll see a lot more feature requests sent through the governance process. And I think once people realize that, it's like, oh, hey, I can go here and propose a tool, feature or really anything, and we can discuss it as a community, vote on it, and figure out the best way to do it.

At the end of the day, it is extremely powerful and different from how decision-making is done at traditional companies. It just goes back to the thesis of how we think we will shake up so many industries with Ethereum and Decentralized Tech. It backs up everything we have been saying and just makes us excited that we finally are releasing minting next week. So everyone will be able to start minting as decentralized as possible. I think that's everything that we have really to go over. 

## Community Questions ‚ùì [[25:48]](https://youtu.be/BKVvObpaOV8?t=1548)

Let me check and see if we have any questions in the discord for the project calls. We don't have any questions. Just a few people asking for beta access. And again, we just want to thank everyone for trying to break it. We appreciate you all. That helps us a lot, having the community help with stuff like that. The more and more that we learn about decentralization and the more and more that the whole industry moves, we will start trying to figure out more ways to get people involved.

Every day, we have people asking how to get involved. And it's tough right now because we're so tunnel-visioned in on what we're building. But the vital thing here is that in about 3 months when we have all of our products out. We have this truly decentralized open-source code published to everyone; that's when the real contributions can start; anyone should be able to come on and be I can contribute code or I can contribute this or that. 

Having our code open-source will allow people to come in and build things that they want to develop or be able to access or do whatever they could to build their own front end and use Universe back end. But really, that's open-source, decentralized architecture. We're trying to develop it so that anyone can come in and build, and we can all build together. Because at the end of the day, that's what decentralization is. That's what a Ethereum is. We're all technically building on Ethereum. Some are building on Barnbridge, or Universe, or Compound Finance, but we are building on Universe in the end.

I'm sorry, on Ethereum. So, we see Universe moving in that direction, whereas we're going to be a marketplace. Still, we'll see tools and dApps in technology and infrastructure built on top of Universe in the future to grow the ecosystem. Honestly, we want to develop scalable open-source products that people can come and contribute to and build on top of. That's the end goal right now. We're not there yet, but we are moving towards there because we want the world to contribute. This is what this is all about. We want anyone to be able to come in and contribute. We're trying to figure it out, and we just want everyone to know it's coming, we're not there yet, but once we get there, everyone who has the capacity to help will be able to help. I think that's all we got. Does anybody have any other things they want to mention or state of the community? 

Trevor, do you want to say what's up? I think this is your first project call.

### Introduction: [Trevor L.](https://twitter.com/Speculor2)‚Äî CTO GRAVITON üëã [[29:18]](https://youtu.be/BKVvObpaOV8?t=1758) 

**Trevor:** Thanks, Mark. So I'll actually be coming on as CTO of Multiverse. We're going to be releasing some exciting products on top of XYZ DOA and the whole Universe Ecosystem. So very excited to be working on the project and looking forward to working with everybody.

**Mark:** Likewise, Trevor is Uber smart. He's probably one of the most intelligent people. Tyler talks very highly of him. I've never met Trevor personally, but I've heard fantastic things about him. So we're really excited to have him on the team.

**Trevor:** Thanks, Mark.

**Mark:** Honestly, that's the wormhole stuff; like I was saying, we want to build infrastructure and tech on top of Universe wormholes, it is kind of the first step of doing that, and we're really excited. We're not going to get much info on that, but definitely keep looking for the Alpha on Wormhole because it's out there. I always look at Troy when I'm talking about this. 

**Troy:** I feel like you're waiting for me to say something. I guess I could give a quick update. So we did hire a Dev Shop to start working on the MVPs for Wormhole and Deguild. We are fingers crossed we might actually have MVP for Dguild by Montarsal down here in Puerto Rico, which would be pretty cool because it's kind of like a Patreon-Type system for artists and a variety of being on the lookout for that. But I can't get too deep into it because we literally just kind of pretty much started on all that. Trevor has been spinning up the orchestrator node for the live peer network that will be running Wormhole. We've had a couple of calls with the Live Pier team, and it looks like there's going to be some really cool stuff coming out in the middle of Q4. But I'm not really supposed to talk about it past that. There are many things in motion, but I think you will probably start seeing the detailed stuff. Then when Wormhole launches, you'll start to kind of understand how this whole ecosystem is going to be tying together. It will supplement what's going on in Universe and bring a new type of model to the market.

So we're excited about showing it to everyone, but just know it's deep, deep in development right now.

## Newsletter üìú [[32:09]](https://youtu.be/otSaW_UN1MA?t=1929)

**Mark:** I also want to point out, and just mention, that we're actually working on a newsletter we want to start doing monthly or maybe bi-monthly newsletters kind of about what's going on in the industry, new technology that's coming out. NFT drops in the space. Eventually, we'll get to the point where we have curated drops, and we'll try to figure out a process for that. But that's stuff we've been talking about internally, and we'll put those drops on the newsletter in that curated drop process or feature drop process, whatever you want to call it. It's going to be decentralized from a standpoint, and we're not going to have the situation where the OpenSea team is front running making the centralized decision. We'll make this decision together and vote on what is getting put on Universe, and everyone's going to know and not be able to front-run each other because we all decide together. But basically, our newsletter is going to be coming out. When Universe first dropped our website, we had a landing page it said, give us your email.

If you've done that, we have your email, and you're going to get a newsletter. If you have not done that yet and want the newsletter sent to your email, I would go to the Universe XYZ and give your email at the bottom of the page in the email landing spot. So we have that. We don't know if we're doing bimonthly or just once a month, but eventually, I think with how fast NFT space is moving and how quickly NFT drops are coming out, we'll just kind of play it by ear at first. We'll get a few out to start and see how we're feeling. But we'll have all sorts of cool stuff like Artist spotlights. And you can assume we're going to have pretty awesome artists like we have PAK at our party, a lot of popular artists. Tyler, is pretty involved with a lot of people. And so are Tim and Troy as well. They have a ton of artists like [PplPleaser](https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1).

**Troy:** We're actually trying to explore with the newsletter to create a high-quality interview every month with an artist. And the interviewer could be someone who's outside of the system too. You could have guest interviewers, right? That's kind of what we're looking at to try to do. And we're in the process of setting up the operations around getting all that running.

**Mark:** Imagine if Homer Shilson interviewed people, and we just posted that. Who knows what Homer would ask people? But we love you, Homer. I think that's everything we covered. Mostly everything. The big takeaway, November 2, NFT-NYC. Don't miss it. Tickets are on sale if you have a polymorph. I guess they're not on sale. They're for free. If you have a Polymorph lost poet or a lobby lobster. So link in the description link in the agenda. We'll share the link in discord. So thank you, everyone. Hit like subscribe share with your friends. Tell your mom about us. Thank you all. We love you, Universe.
