## Intro  [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec)

**Mark:** Hello, everyone! Welcome to project call number seven. We are excited to have you back. We're back to our schedule of project calls on Thursdays. (every other Thursday)

First off, we want to say thank you to everyone. This is the first call since the Polymorph got launched. I want to say I don't think it could have been more successful. It blew away all of our expectations. We want to say thank you to the community. We couldn't have done it without you guys. The months of support we received and you all waited for us to come back around and finally drop some NFTs. 

The support was overwhelming. We want to say thank you to you all, and we appreciate you! Also, we're not stopping. We're going to keep building. 

Congrats to the team. After four months of hard work, we finally see the fruits of our labour. Everyone certainly deserves a pat on the back, and we are ready for the next one. 

I'll let Tyler take over this call. I believe he has some things to address about the Polymorphs, the community and the airdrops.


## Polymorphs 🧫🦹  [[01:23]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=83)

**Tyler:** I don't want to run all the calls in the future, from the perspective of slowly rolling this out as a community project and the larger thing I'd like to point out. It needs to be clear to the community that I'm not taking credit for everything that happened with all the Twitter spaces and even the Discords. 

A lot of the things that we're rolling out are very much collectively decided. It's been months of work. (Even a ton of things surrounding the airdrops) When some of the FUD was coming in, it was like days of battling it. I'll jump in and stick up for the team– so, naturally, I became the most publicly outspoken. I don't want anyone to believe that this stuff is a singular decision made by myself. 

Pretty much everyone on the call– on top of others who rarely join calls, designers, front-end devs and the like. Including people like George– Zhivko's counterpart –he's not on this call, and he's the one that brought Polymorphs to the forefront. So, I would like to give a special shoutout to the team because I've stepped into the limelight, but it more so felt like the line of fire. However, I wanted to jump in a have everything explained correctly. 

### What We Learned  [[03:11]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=191)

So, since we are on public calls and people consume information in different ways. The volume of pushback about NFTs (when we first dropped) came from set standards/bias regarding the rarity measurements for projects and how projects handle ranking systems. And choosing what's cool and what isn't. When we launched Polymorphs, I think I said– at the time –it's the most technologically advanced NFT to every drop. 

I believe it also threw a ton of the NFT community off. Because of how the dynamics were set up. I think that's cool and special. There have been innovative and unique NFTs that have been launched over the years. (That I follow) I was quite involved in the Punk community, and I used to own around twenty Punks. My favourite aspect of Punks was the community pushing forward the majority of what is now known as a rarity. Yes, we know, the team did it. But, there was also self-discovery within the community. All the rarity tools, and other aspects like that, were not established by the Larva Labs team– at the onset.

I believe my favourite thing about Polymorphs is that this is not something that evolves in one day. We dropped something completely different than what originally existed. It's not only us but also the community and usage. And preference of product gets determined on an individual basis. (what one is preferred over another)

If you look at the progression of what I would say are– technologically enhanced NFTs. Punks introduced a ton to the ecosystem and will likely always be known as the Bitcoin of NFTs. And I think they're amazing. Then you have Jimmy, who launched Avastars, which pushed heavy for on-chain metadata. The way they minted those NFTs with layered SVGs, and you would scroll and scroll to find them. 

I want to say in the article I wrote– the Avastars are continuing to get minted. You can slightly game how the scrolling function works now. That wasn't a knock on the project, but it was more of a hat tip to an extremely cool launch. I don't think anyone can do it again. The bots have already started to game those and list them on the Avastars market. That's simply an example of what CryptoPunks did. 

Then you have Hashmasks, and what they did that was cool was pairing an ERC-20 token to the mask that allows you to customize the NFT by changing the name. They put a ton of effort into that drop. I would then say Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) was likely the first group that truly, nailed it and realized the community-driven aspect of an NFT project. They almost went full-tilt effort for the community.

If you look at these things roll-out, you can see the similarities between them and how other projects emulate aspects of past projects while adding their touch to it. But they don't– from a technology perspective –the art is amazing. I love several of these NFTs. But from a tech perspective, they don't quite do what we did. By changing the narrative and the characteristics of how these things work. 

So, I think that threw lots of people off. Specifically, collectors who were in a groove and believed this is how we do X-Y-Z, this is how everything is done. So, naturally, there was some backlash and confusion– FUD. 

That's what it stands for. 

- F.EAR 
- U.NCERTAINTY 
- D.OUBT 

I think we did a great job at explaining these things and how they work. We don't need to elaborate on this call. Otherwise, I will end up talking about things at a high level. I'd also invite everyone to read the most recent Medium article about how Polymorphs work.

- [New Game Theory Who Dis?](https://medium.com/universe-xyz/new-game-theory-who-dis-e521835630dd)
- [Polymorphic Universe](https://medium.com/universe-xyz/polymorphic-universe-8470e14629b4)

Some of the terminologies that have developed have been amazing. I never thought that non-scrambled or non-morphed NFTs were going to be what people wanted. I kind of viewed those as floor Punks. Because you have to use the NFT– morph it & scramble it – so it looks better. Our NFTs work from a proof of work perspective, where you need to utilize ETH and play around with it, to figure out what you want and what the outcomes can be. To get one that looks cool. But I do understand the concept of some of the ones looking cool as virgins off the rip. I can see how that's coveted. 

I believe that's similar to Punks. And that's going to be something that people figure out over time. When they initially dropped them, people assumed that aliens would be the most popular, and then people looked into 5-6 attributes being rarer than aliens. I think some of that will happen here. When something new is dropped, it's not just us deciding it. I also believe that's one of the best aspects of the project. 

[Aly](https://twitter.com/youngalgy) did a great job explaining that on one of the Twitter spaces. Essentially, unlike the majority of the projects before us like Bored Apes– Gold Ape, CryptoPunks– Ape & Alien. The project decided what was rare and what was cool in that scenario.

With Polymorphs, it will very much be the community and the ecosystem that drives that. And I believe there is something inherently special about that. 

Let me check down a few points– from the Agenda. So, I make sure I go through it all. 

### Virgins (Unscrambled)  [[10:30]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=636)

**Tyler:** Virgins are Polymorphs that have never gotten scrambled and have never been morphed. That's an example of a community-driven aspect in itself. Because we did not make that up or attribute it to Polymorphs, It's a phrase that came from the community. I think GMoney termed them that, and now it is what it is.

### Scrambling 

For those watching this for the first time, one of the powerful things about Polymorphs is that you can scramble every single trait in your Polymorph. You can take the base Polymorph and scramble all traits and attributes. 

There is also morphing, which allows you to change a single trait.

Scrambling works on a flat curve. It's 0.01 ETH to reset your Polymorph and reset the bonding curve. 

Morphing works on a bonding curve. The first morph is around 0.02 ETH, and the next time you roll, it's on a bonding curve, so the amount of ETH needed to morph a single trait gets increased. (~0.04 ETH)

I'm not entirely sure of the math. We'll release all of that. However, essentially, it becomes more and more expensive to change individual attributes. And that causes a game theory where you have to attempt a  scramble to morph it into a perfect Polymorph. 

### Rarity 

**Tyler:** When you're looking at rarity, it's not an individual trait that's rare. No helmets, characters or anything else is rarest. What becomes rare is the pairing of specific traits. For example, this is the only Marijuana with a weed shirt and two bongs in their hands. That doesn't even exist yet. I've talked to a few people, and that's precisely what they want. (a lot of people) So, if someone morphs that, IMO, that will likely be the most coveted Polymorph– after that point in time.

Then people will do more and more advanced Morphs/Scrambles. For example, morph to a full monkey astronaut with two bananas in his hands. It's interesting if everyone morphs to complete sets. But you can aim for no set. A guy in Discord suggested– literally what I was thinking –take the Diamond Fox in their underwear, with no shirt, hat, pants, shoes, only two diamonds in their hand. (no items)

As we play around with it, you'll get the ability to morph coveted Polymorphs. Based on individual trait pairings– as opposed to singular traits.

That's game-breaking, and for people to say there is nothing rare about Polymorphs, it's because it's not being viewed from that way. And an additional aspect to the rarity of these things– we mapped an entire genome where we can add succeeding traits. We can add a Polymorph having a pet. If you look at them, they can have earrings, belts, bracelets etc.

So, a lot of that stuff has not been introduced. The DAO will decide when those types of things get introduced. It then gets interesting– when you scramble, you might end up with a pet. The full morphs without pets may end up being the most coveted. That may throw a wrench into everyone's opinion about not scrambling virgins. If you wait on it, it will become harder to get a monkey in an astronaut suit with two bananas but without a dog– for instance. 

I don't believe anyone has this figured out yet. I think it's getting figured out by all of us in real-time. I want to be very clear it's not like there aren't rarities. Typical rarity tools don't know how to calculate them. Or other people don't know-how. But, there are actual rarities for these things. 

### Future Development

**Tyler:** We didn't announce any of this when we started it because I'm not sure we quite understood where any of this was heading. We didn't launch with a dev roadmap– which I've seen plenty of projects do. We wanted to see what the reception was and where we could go from there. But, I personally, love this project a lot. However, I didn't come up with the idea or any of the designs. I didn't write any of the code– I'm a community member like everyone else –I don't get paid by Universe.

I legitimately want to work on this. Because I think it's the coolest NFT drop that I've seen in a very, very long time. I also believe there is a ton of really cool stuff we can do with it. So, at the end of the day, when we do those drops– around 800 ETH was raised when we sold them & the ongoing revenue from morphs/scrambles– it all heads to the DAO. 

The thing that is different about the Polymorph drop compared to a lot of other NFT projects. The money never went to us, it went into a DAO where a community will essentially run. We all have to vote on how the funds are used together. We can't 'rug' or take that money out of it. I think that's empowering. The point here is– we didn't approach this with a predetermined roadmap. It's up to the community to decide what we build. We have hired internal developers and designers/resources to work on this. However, the community will have to work with us.

I think a lot of this will start getting cranked out in a DAO first format. 

## Airdrops 🚁🎁 [[17:47]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=1067)

**Tyler:** The final thing– about Polymorphs –before I stop. I think that the Polymorph community (I believed the XYZ community would be the primary buyers of Polymorphs, In large part) is at least around ~50%. 

Several people had no idea what Universe was, what a DAO is or how any of this worked. They became very active in our community, and we decided to add them to the airdrop. That gets distributed to the people who stuck around our Discord ever since we dropped Non-Fungible Pepe. We had to pivot and rebuild everything from scratch to create this entire Universe.

So, Dragos was going to be on this call. But, he had to take some time off. I can discuss the airdrop dynamics. However, I would like Ryan to talk about the Dr. Opium mechanics and how it works. So I'm not the only one talking on this call. 

I did go through with the community as an announcement. There was some backlash. Not from the NFT and Polymorph community, but there was a backlash from the Discord community. They felt as if their airdrop was getting diluted.

The reason we decided to do that– we favour community & we want to build one. I think thus far, we've created a fantastic community. On top of the fact I said we were not dealt the best hand from the get-go. Things went wrong, but we built through it together. When I talk about the community– I almost talk about it in tears –where there are people that legitimately stuck around and stuck with us. They got added to what's called an expanded airdrop. Which was intended to be an airdrop, but it ended up in vesting contracts. 

It was labelled as Community Discretionary. Originally it was meant to be 30 but ended up being more than 100 people. Even some of them were added as contributors or ended up putting capital towards seed. So, I believe we had nearly 170 vesting contracts that were set up. Those were the people that we thought had helped the most to help us get back to where we needed to be. And where we were a legitimate project still. 

Another thing, we had ~3000 people, and we were under the impression that around 1-2 thousand of those people would have claimed the airdrop. But, it ended up being ~300 people that claimed the drop. So, the dynamics surrounding the airdrop and the duration being 20-weeks posed a security risk to the project. Because people entered for Non-Fungible Pepe airdrop then left the Discord and then came back 3-months later. (you can see this by looking at their profiles) Then they joined the new airdrop.

However, they didn't bid on an NFP. They didn't stick around and build with us through the trenches– stepping up to fight ~300 trolls. Then they didn't even buy a Polymorph. Those are likely people that feel the most shafted, but they are the people that have supported us the least compared to the others on that list. I'm sorry if it sucks to hear. But, it is what it is. It's a security risk for the project that us doing the airdrop with that many people for that many tokens, on such a short time frame would put those people in control of the 4.5 million we raised in the seed round and the nearly 2 million that Polymorphs brought into the treasury. 

We have expectations from the community, the seed investors, Polymorph buyers and the others who put up ~4.5 million. We need to ensure that doesn't get rugged or pulled because that wouldn't be our intention. We changed the dynamic, and we've been having these conversations for weeks. We adjusted the dynamics of how the airdrop works, and we added the Polymorph people. Not only because we wanted them a part of the community, but we did it for the long-term security of the protocol. I believe the majority of people who stayed with us the entire time understand why we did it. The majority of the backlash comes from people loosely following. Or they're only in our Discord for the airdrop. 

We are not building for those people. We're building for those who want to create with us for a long, long time. That's why we changed things how we did. It wasn't an impulsive decision. It wasn't ill-thought-out. It was a result of a long time of us figuring out how to fix a problem. Only 300 people signed up (out of ~3000) for a massive chunk of what would eventually govern money that is supposed to be going towards building out this project.

With that said. I want to stop completely talking because I'm sure others would like to hear other people speak– aside from me. But, I think it's good. We can get Ryan to explain the dynamics of how Dr. Opium works. 

Because it's not an airdrop, It's the same as when we dropped Polymorphs because it's not anything that the NFT community has seen before. We bit off a project called Opium and edited it quite a bit. And Opium is a DeFi protocol that I doubt a large amount of the NFT community knows. 

So, Ryan, if you can explain the dynamics– we'll have Medium articles once it goes live. 

### Airdrop Dynamics [[24:13]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=1453)

**Ryan:** Essentially, the Dr. Opium airdrop style incentives holding an airdrop as long as they can. In our case, it will be 100-weeks. The best way to maximize your allocation is to wait for the entire duration and not touch the airdrop.

What does it look like if you claim earlier?

On the very first day of the airdrop, you'll have the ability to claim roughly 1% of the entire allocation that you would receive. As you claim, the tokens get redistributed to everybody else pool. So, if I claim 1000 tokens on the first day, the next person immediately after me could claim 1020, then the next time 1060 and so forth.

Additionally, you don't get tokens only from forfeiture. You also receive more linearly over time. So, if you receive 1% on the first day, you may receive 1.5% the next day and so forth– across 100-weeks. 

Creating a unique dynamic where anyone who doesn't care too much about XYZ and would like their tokens ASAP (to dump them) get a small allocation and can do that early on. Those who would like to support the protocol. And want to eventually vote in the DAO (in it for the long haul) they get the bulk of the rewards.

**Tyler:** Ryan is a lot better than me at being succinct.

**Ryan:** If you'd like, I can cover some auctions and minting updates as well. 

**Mark:** Yeah! That would help.

## Auctions & Minting 🥼⚗️  [[25:50]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=1550)

**Ryan:** Auction and minting will be the next product that we release. I can't go through too many details regarding how these auctions will look. But, we're excited because they're innovative and very different from the typical methods of the industry. 

We had a massive overhaul of the auctions over the last few weeks. That has kind of completed the first round of audits. We're ready to make some changes that we've been working on– getting prepared for the next round of audits. Additionally, there have been UI overhauls to make everything seamless– making it as easy as possible to both set up an auction and mint the NFTs that go into it. As well, the bidding and participation aspects of auctions.

What's cool is the minting flow that we're developing. At the moment, it's supporting two different collections– like minting on Rarible –you can mint NFTs into the Universe collection. (A single 1/1 NFT)

or

You can deploy a personal collection. 

We'll have different options. Maybe not at launch. But we are looking toward supporting multiple different ERC-721 types. You'll have the ability to choose which token you would like to deploy. We'll give details about the types and which are better for specific use cases. (Helping you make an informed decision)

It will be extensible. It will cover a lot of ground that places like OpenSea and elsewhere cannot offer yet. That's going to be exciting. 

**Mark:** I think a lot of artists have been waiting for this. The particular tool that Ryan is talking about– the ability to have a minting contract. I believe it eliminates many issues. And it fixes a lot of needs for artists in the space right now.

The good news is that– It's almost ready! 🎉

We just need a little bit more time. ⏲️🤏

### Airdrops (Breakdown)  [[27:50]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=1670)

**Mark:** I think one thing I would like to touch on. I don't think Tyler mentioned it– the actual breakdown of the airdrop– since revision/adding Polymorph holders.

Initially, I believe it got set at 6% for the Discord community. That ended up getting split in half. 

New allocations;

- Discord Community (3%)
- Polymorph Holders (3%)
- NFP Bidders (2%)

One thing I'd like to point out. Although, anyone in the Discord that was included in the original airdrop allocation and bought a Polymorph. You still end up getting both airdrops– it may be slightly less. However, Ryan spoke about the airdrop game theory. Depending on how you play. Game theory could affect your allocation and what you ultimately end up receiving. 

That's one thing to take away from all of this. How you play this game will affect your outcome. No matter what airdrop class you are in, all are pooled together. So, if all the Pepe bidders leave early, the allocation gets reverted over to the other people remaining. Those tokens are forfeited if you claim early. 

You give up whatever you don't have to claim yet. But, as Ryan was saying, you earn more every day as your ability to claim more becomes available. It gets to the point that every person will have a choice when they think it's worth it to claim or stay. It's quite interesting because everyone will behave differently. 

We saw this via the Dr. Opium airdrop. Nobody acts the same, and that's why it's so cool. 

**Tyler:** I'll also add to that. I think some of the reasons that several of the oldest OGs were least upset was because we diluted the pool to more people. A large piece of feedback was– if the Polymorph people immediately dump their tokens. They're essentially going to be paying penalties to the people who are holding long-term for the project.

I think the most likely people to dump their tokens are the ones who signed up for the airdrop, left, came back and then signed up for the airdrop again and became active. That's not to call out anyone in particular. I've even called out enthusiastic people. So, I don't want anyone to think I'm responding to anyone specifically.

My point is if the Discord community is right and the Polymorph community does have weak hands. If you planned to hold long and support the project– that's better for you. 

I would view it as; 

If you planned on getting something short-term from us and not sticking with us long-term. I don't care.

If your plan was sticking with us long-term, then you are going to get rewarded.

That's the way you should be looking at it. 

## PSA 📣  [[31:49]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=1909)

**Mark:** Another thing we want to make clear. Something we didn't foresee, and Tyler mentioned it earlier– we had thought most of the people buying these NFTs were XYZ community members. That threw us a curveball, and we were a little blown away when this thing sold out in 30-minutes. We figured out it was not only the XYZ community that primarily bought them.

**Tyler:** We've not completely run the numbers of all the potential buyers of Polymorphs and their affiliation with XYZ. People may have been missed that hold vesting contracts, providing L/P and even some whales.

I believe after everything is taken into account. It's not the way it looks if you run a simple wallet script on Etherscan. With that said, let's say it's somewhere in the 40-60% range. We still very much grew our community with new people excited about Universe and XYZ that were not there before.

So, really, at this point, there is no us vs. them. We are all the same people now. The Polymorph holders are XYZ holders, and so I don't care when people came in. That's not what a DAO is supposed to be about, the "Who got in first? – bullshit." It's who is coming in and providing value now and who is helping. That's who we need to take care of & the Polymorph community is dope– as fu*k. I want to put on for them as we have for the XYZ community.

When the DAO activates, then nobody has to put on for anybody. We all run this together, and that's the beauty of it. We're all the same now. 

**XYZ ALIENS TOOK OVER THE PLANET!** (Universe)

**Mark:** I think that's the main thing to say here. There is no us and them. We're all on the same team, and Polymorphs is an XYZ drop, and it's always going to be. We want the Polymorphs community to be aligned with our long-term incentives and what we want to accomplish.

Which is– empower artists and create cool technology for the NFT community. To explore and play.

Like Tyler mentioned on a Twitter space, we want to build cool shit. We're not bashing any projects. We're not saying existing projects are not cool. However, we think, and with Tyler/Troy's background in DeFi, they believe there is more with NFTs than people are doing. That's something that we want to explore. It's cool technology– connecting custom Smart contracts to NFTs, and creating unique things with them. That's what we believe the future is, and this is only the start of some amazing technology. 

We hope that people go over our code and figure out different things to do with it. We've made it open-source. And we'll continue to make wicked open-source tools like this. So people can do drops like this, and we can all innovate this space together. 

Because this was a framework we would love to see, and we think that others will come up with fantastic innovations and drops with these Polymorph contracts. And that's just innovation. That's how it works. Someone takes what's been done and redoes it differently– a little bit better.

**Tyler:** It's not only Troy and me. It's a conglomeration of several people excited about this, about media, NFTs, DeFi and DAOs.

We've got the whole DMOBB squad. They've done a lot for BarnBridge and helped us find dev talent. This helped build out a lot of the backend for the DAO and yield farming. They'll be helping long-term on a lot of the scaling infrastructure. We've got Limechain, and they came from Bond bet. They're the ones who brought the Polymorphs idea to the table, helping us build that out. 

We have the entire proof systems squad, which I established before BarnBridge. They're cranking out a ton of the design and the UX. Ryan came from NFP, and he wanted to help us build battle gaming for it. He's been a gem and is essentially running product at this point. Then we've Aly and Nick that are helping across the board. And Tim (Illestrater) is extremely excited about NFTs. [He recently revealed that he's been working with us behind the scenes for a while.](https://twitter.com/illestrater_/status/1410158250935209984) 

He's been busting his ass on the [Sevens grant](https://twitter.com/SevensGrant) idea– designed to empower artists all over the world. He's been working with Paris Hilton. 

- [Grant.art (Sevens Grant)](https://grants.art/)

Also, this isn't a me-too NFT project. Most of us began working in decentralized media before a grande portion of the NFT community even knew what an NFT was. That's a fact of the matter. So, we are here for it and excited to build this. But, it's not just myself and Troy.

**Mark:** Yeah, it's an entire team for sure. We all look up to Tyler and Troy at XYZ– and Tim. 

I believe that's the majority of what we have. 

## Community Questions ❓ [[37:49]](https://youtu.be/VVBaY-zbCec?t=2269)

**Mark:** There are some community questions.

I'm not sure what this question is asking. But, I think it's asking about what tokens are available to be used on the auction house and marketplace.

Short answer; We'll allow you to use essentially any token on the marketplace, and for the auctions, I believe there is a way to add a custom token. 

You'll have the availability to use ETH, XYZ, BOND – any of the tokens you are farming with. The majority of common tokens will also be available, like USDC. You'll have the ability to make a bid with almost any token. (As per designs)

Secondly, another question regarding whether or not we make an activity chart for the Polymorphs & scrambles. (A history)

We are working on this. But we need time to get everything figured out. And get it pushed live. As Tyler said, we're going to start allocating some resources to a Polymorph team. It will consist of a few devs and designers that will build out the UI and add additional features proposed by the DAO. 

A separate team will get that done. So, we don't divide our current arrangement. It already appears we are getting a ton of recommendations for new features. Moving resources over to the Polymorphs and creating a team is where we are at right now. We're working on that.

Honestly, any ideas from the community, let us know. We're thinking about future development and stuff that we need to complete for you guys to make Polymorphs more fun and easier to use. And all information is available. To buy or scramble– whatever it may be.

The community is going hard. It appears we have a few people working on rarity builds. I believe a few devs are working on rarity charts– learning how to pull together a tool from the graph. I'm not entirely sure what the progress is on that. But, I do know that we have a few community members helping with this. 

**Tyler:** There is one thing you can bring up about that, Mark.

Firstly, I believe several people believe that DAOs are a new and revolutionary thing that we created. Because they haven't followed DeFi and DAOs. That's not the case. There are tons of people around the world working on DAOs, and that's why we anticipate it will be a DAO 
summer. 

We're still figuring a lot out as an entire industry. Like, how does someone raise their hand? How do they enter and help? How do we accurately decentralize this?

So, we're not there yet as an industry. (Or at Universe)

But we're working on it. So, people who are people working on those rarity tools, it if becomes a big ongoing thing. We need to have a way to vet out talent and ensure people are not frauds. You post a job on Upwork. Several people bid on it and then don't do the job correctly. 

How do you get a framework that allows you to monitor all of that?

Making sure everything is getting done properly, and people are not siphoning off your resources. While it also remains open, and people can try things out and raise their hands. That's not only a problem we are trying to figure out. However, that's how DAOs function at scale.

People come in help with rarity tools they get a grant. Or we compensate them for it. We're not there yet, but that's where we are trying to go. So, shoutout to the people who are doing that. And if they deliver a working product, then I believe we should retroactively compensate them. For doing the work because we didn't have to and we've got other shit that we are working on too. 

It doesn't mean we cannot handle it. But the amount of people we have coming in to offer help is crazy, but we need infrastructure in place for that first. Although, when people come in & provide value like that– we'll compensate you. 

**Mark:** Another comment. We are working towards establishing a bounty/grant program for XYZ. Ryan and I will be working on that over the next week. So, we'll get that setup. There will likely be a Gitcoin/Github– you should see that come out.

I don't know if we have any bounties at the moment. However, we are setting it up for these situations. When teams are building rarity tools– as Tyler mentioned –we need to ensure they get retroactively compensated.

I believe that's everything for this call. I would like to shout out Algy– he's doing a Polymorph giveaway on Twitter right now! So, if anyone is trying to win a Polymorph, there is a giveaway for that.

**Tyler:** Also, Algy, explain the tweeting vortex!

### Universe Tweet Chain

**Algy:** If you join our Discord via the website. At the bottom, there is a link! (or at the bottom of these notes 😉)

In one of the channels, there is a tweet chain. It's already gone pretty far, and it starts on Tylers Twitter if you would like to look there. [Start](https://twitter.com/BullishBillie/status/1410438775755329545)

You go to the end of the tweet chain and continue it. We've taken over the Universe. It's because we are a bunch of aliens invading the Twitter space. So, jump in our Discord and get involved. 

The channel is: #polymorph-alien-follow

> The directions are: on the most recent tweet in the thread, hit the recycling arrows and choose quote tweet. Make the words the same thing as everyone else. Hit send.

**Tyler:** Yes! Polymorph alien follow. And the concept is that at the very end, I'm going to retweet it from the Universe thread. (It got started by a guy named Billie) 

It will get put in our announcements so people can click through the Polymorph avatars and follow everyone. Then we can become a prominent squad on Twitter. That's what we're doing.

**Mark:** Polymorphs are already taking over Twitter. All I see is Polymorphs.

**Tyler:** That's because we follow every single fu*king one. 😂

**Aly:* It's fun too, there were funny moments last night, and we were all laughing hard. So, it's fun– get involved.

**Mark:** Yeah, the memes are unbelievable.

Aly has a meme competition going on because of the giveaway. The memes in that channel are unbelievable. 

My favourite one:

> **Anakin:** "I finally scrambled the double corn guns." **Padme:** "Oh, so that's the last scramble then, right?" **Anakin:** "😈" **Padme:** "That's the last scramble, right?...😨"

**Tyler:** Yo, we did for BarnBridge, and we need to keep that going. We need a grants bounty for that. Those are the best memes I've ever seen in my life.

**Mark:** Yeah, so, honestly, after Algy's giveaway, we'll probably start something.

**Tyler:** We need to gather them all up and figure out where they all are. We need a repository in some capacity. 

**Algy:** I'll start saving them all in a folder.

**Mark:** And we have all the old BarnBridge memes too. We'll probably take a few of those memes and have our artists rework them and perhaps add them to some of the merchandise. For real, they're amazing.

Also, regarding what Tyler is talking about– we have a weekly meme competition that we've been running since around the second or third week of starting the bounty program on Gitcoin. We giveaway 50$ to anyone who creates the best memes or gets the most engagement. It slightly depends. Sometimes I'll measure the engagement. And other times certain memes blow everything away– that one typically wins. 

It's a fun thing that we do and allows tons of people to get involved. After Algy's giveaway, we'll start weekly meme competitions– in Discord –so that everyone gets a chance to win a bit of USDC or ETH. 

I think that's everything. Thank you, everyone, for joining us.
