## Intro [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/_0YsbpMqF4E)

**Mark:** Hey, everyone! Welcome to xyzDAO Project Call number four.

We're excited to have you all here. If you've been tuning into the updates this week, we've been extremely active. 

And we finally released the docs!

So everyone knows, we'll be releasing a few more docs around how our products work and how you can use the minting function. The docs need to get completed. When they come out in full– there is more to look forward to. 

I'm going to hand it over to Dragos, and he will give big updates on Yield Farming. I think a ton of people are interested in knowing what's happening and the dates. 

So, Dragos if you would like to take it over.


**Dragos:** Thank you very much, Mark! It's a pleasure and an honour to talk here. 

Before we do this, I want to show everyone something...!

🐱❗

This little guy. 

Anyway, let's get back to the important stuff. 

## Yield Farming (need to know) [[01:11]](https://youtu.be/_0YsbpMqF4E?t=71) 🧑‍🌾🚜

**Dragos:** We are ready to get this rolled out. The warm-up period starts on Monday next week.

### Epochs

**Dragos:** We're going to launch on Monday at midnight UTC. (in one week)

That's one thing, and when it comes to the epochs, the duration of each will be about seven days. (one week– same as BarnBridge)


### Token Farming

**Dragos:**  Out of the token supply– we are looking at allocating around 7% (70,000) to 7 pools. You'll be able to yield farm XYZ token with: 

- Aave
- Bond
- Compound
- Link (ChainLink)
- SNX (Synthetix)
- Sushi
- ILV (Illuvium)

I love the name of ILV– it is my favourite.

That covers yield farming. 

### Sushi LP and LP Token Farming

**Dragos:** We'll have a Sushi L/P pool. The token amount supplied will be 6% of the total XYZ token supply. (60,000) 

If I haven't mentioned it yet– the total supply is one million. Now everyone should be aware of that. The Epoch length is one week. 

So, you'll enter the Sushi L/P pool. After you are a liquidity provider, you can come back and stake your L/P tokens in the yield farm, and you'll get rewards for that.

During the warm-up period on Monday, everyone will have access to the yield farms, and you can learn how everything works. 

The first epoch starts Monday at midnight UTC, and the L/P token farm follows the second week. So, that's how the first amount of XYZ tokens get distributed.

That's essentially it– that should cover it. 

Oh, one more thing. DAO staking, you'll have the ability to stake your XYZ within the DAO. You'll get rewards that way as well, and around 5% of the total token supply gets allocated to that, which amounts to 50,000.

> **For those that do not know: The tokenomics were revised since this call and upon launch. The amounts are slightly different.**  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The token supply is 1,000,000,000 (Billion)

Revised allocations;

Yield Farming Pools: 3,500,000; (20 Weeks)
- AAVE: 500,000
- BOND: 500,000
- COMP: 500,000
- LINK: 500,000
- SNX: 500,000
- SUSHI: 500,000
- ILV: 500,000

USDC/XYZ SushiSwap Pool: 600,000; (100 Weeks)

$XYZ DAO Staking: 1,000,000; (50 Weeks)

Team: 2,307,692.31 ; (104 Weeks)

Contributors: 2,019,230.77; (104 Weeks)

Advisors vesting: 192,307.692; (104 Weeks)

([XYZ token distribution](https://docs.universe.xyz/tokens/token-distribution))

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Mark:** Nice!

Dragos, to clarify, the warm-up period that you are talking about is that similar to BarnBridge? 

Where we opened up the UI for a week? 

Before farming began, users could get an understanding of the UI and lock their funds early.

**Dragos:** (Nods)

**Mark:** What Dragos is saying— You can play around for around a week and the following week is when the epoch officially starts. 

**Dragos:** 👍👍

Two thumbs up from me!

**Mark:** That's when you'll start earning those rewards.

First off, thank you, Dragos, that was perfect. 

## Airdrops [[04:32]](https://youtu.be/_0YsbpMqF4E?t=272)  🚁🎁

**Mark:** Another thing I would like to go over. I think everyone is extremely interested in this– after the announcements this week. The 'airdrops.'

### Dr. Opium

**Mark:** We got inspired by the Dr. Opium Airdrop by Opium finance. You can check them out: [opium.finance](https://opium.finance) It's a cool project!

### How it works

**Mark:** I want to dive into how it works because not everyone reads the articles, but they listen to the project calls. So I want to make sure everyone has the lowdown on what is going on with the airdrop.

**So, the way it works is this:**

Everyone is entitled to their share of the airdrop. Let's say it's '10 XYZ' tokens. When I first proceed to claim, I may only get to claim around '2' or '3' at that time.

Let's make this easy and say it's '3' tokens. 

As time goes on, I may be able to claim– after so many weeks– '7' tokens. (the timeframes not entirely worked out)

At the end of the period, claimers are entitled to all the tokens initially allocated. 

**Here's the catch:** 

You can exit the pool early and claim your tokens— whenever you would like. 

What happens to the tokens you don't get to claim?

Unclaimed tokens are pushed into the pool and distributed to all the users who stayed in the airdrop. 

You can claim early– as Dragos said: 

> "Take your XYZ tokens and provide liquidity with them." 

Or 

You can eventually stake them in the DAO– once it is activated and thresholds get met– there are reasons to claim early. However, there are also reasons to wait out the claiming period.

### Why it matters

Eventually, if people leave too early– your eligible for all your tokens if you waited until the end– there may be hundreds of XYZ there that were not there before, and you are now eligible for them.

So, there is an interesting trade-off with the airdrop. Dr. Opium eliminates everyone wanting to claim at the same time while also incentivizing people with different behaviours. 

It's a game-theory type experiment. We found it interesting and wanted to try it out versus the standard– free for all claim button. 

This drop seems more fun. I'm excited about it, personally. 

## Breakdown [[07:36]](https://youtu.be/_0YsbpMqF4E?t=456)

**Mark:** I want to explain the dynamics for this and who is eligible.

### Discretionary 8%

About 100 people have helped us and have been extremely active in the community since the beginning. (Some have joined a little later– but have been very helpful nonetheless) We'll be airdropping around 8% of the tokens to roughly 100-101 people. And these tokens are distributed based on your contributions and how active you have been.

Some people we felt needed to get incentivized a bit more than others. But, generally, a majority of people in that pool are getting the same share of tokens as one another.

### Discord 6% (Snapshot late February)

**Mark:** We had an old project that we had to shut down. There was a large community pushing us. It stayed with us and kept pushing on to build and move on. 

They pushed the idea and kept the motivation around Universe, and it was a tough time for us. But, the people that stayed with us and were in the Discord with us on those early times– we took a snapshot in late February. So, currently, we have a Discord bot in the #xyz-airdrop channel in Discord. 

If you were in the Discord in February, you should go to the channel and use the command (!address 0x...) *not ENS names* 

Only post your Ethereum address because it's the only way it will work. There are around 4000 people eligible for that airdrop, and we only have about 250-300 people who have claimed it so far– or at least confirmed their wallet address, and they'll get it. 

**Tyler:** How many people, 350?

**Mark:** Yes.

**Tyler:** Out of 4000? 

I want to make sure we make sure when we tweet this call and make announcements– it must be a massive thing that we highlight– in case this is the way they consume content from Universe. 

If all you watch is the project calls. Then that's around 10% of the people that are eligible for tokens have given us their wallet address to receive them. 

I didn't mean to interrupt you, Mark.

**Mark:** No, it's all good, I agree. I think it's extremely important, and that's why I want to bring it up. 

I'll be tweeting it this week, and I want everyone to tell their friends and let anyone know– if you had friends that were in Discord and perhaps forgot about it. Let them know! If anyone was in there, they are eligible. 

Even if you don't have an Ethereum wallet made yet, your Discord ID and the number attached to your handle– we have that. If you post any (ETH ) wallet address, it will give you that one. 

So, you want to post your wallet address. But, if you didn't have an ETH address at the time (0x...), you can make one and post it in there– then you'll be eligible. 

I want everyone to be fully aware there are still a lot of people that can claim it. So, I want to direct people towards that #xyz-airdrop channel. (This is for people that were in the Discord since February)

### Original Bidders 2%

**Mark:** We'll also be giving about 2% to the original bidders of the previous project. The project we'll call– I think we need a good name– I'll think of it. 

Something like: "The Project that shall remain Unnamed"

> Project name: Big-Untitled-Bang? 

For the unnamed project, the original bidders will get 2% airdropped to their addresses. All of these airdrops are claimable via the 'Dr. Opium Mechanism' and that's why it's important we went over how claiming works. 

### OG Contributors 9%

**Mark:** Also, this week, we decided that we'll be airdropping the original contributors 9% via the Dr. Opium mechanic, which is also large. It balances out the number of people involved in this airdrop. 

If a contributor leaves the airdrop early, a good portion of tokens gets left on the table for the others– in tiers with a lower amount allocated to them. 

For example; the OG bidders: 2% gets allocated to them

I'm unsure of the best way to go about this. The team won't likely comment and tell you their opinions. 

It's up to you, do what you think is best. And honestly, what you think is best, is probably best for you. 

Everyone is different– that's my advice on the situation. 

So, everyone, happy hunting! Enjoy the airdrops. 

## Auctions & Minting [[13:27]](https://youtu.be/_0YsbpMqF4E?t=807) 🥼⚗️

**Mark:** Next, we can talk about the auction and minting. We don't have a ton of updates here.

### Audits

**Mark:** We are about to start our audits, and we'll be pushing the majority of these products live soon. 

Security is something that we take extremely important. At BarnBridge & Universe– we always try to take the necessary steps to guarantee we build secure products. So, audits are not something that we try and rush. 

We want everyone to know we are starting these processes. But, we are not sure when the end is in sight. The good news is, Universe is starting to get audited, and those are some of the last steps before launch.

It's exciting that we are getting to this point. 

### Features

**Mark:** I don't know if we've talked about many of the features of our minting contracts. One of the main features is a 'batch' minting function, which will allow you to mint up to 40 NFTs at one time. 

In theory, this contract is cheaper for someone to mint 40 NFTs at once rather than minting them all individually. I know gas prices are a bit insane lately. But, this contract has a design to reduce some of the fees associated with minting multiple NFTs– when you are creating a collection. It should make it easier for the user. You don't have to mint every single one. 

The cool thing about this is you can mint 40 NFTs and connect them to the auction contracts. 

Similar to the Justin 3BLAU style auction. You can create a tiered auction and mint 40 NFTs to it in one transaction. So, that should be a very cool product, in my opinion. 

## NFTs & Announcements [[15:39]](https://youtu.be/_0YsbpMqF4E?t=939)🌌 📢

**Mark:** Let's talk about some of the NFTs and the announcements that are coming up. 

Al. Want to talk about some of the planets and the progress we're making on the planet drops? 

We're renaming some of our drops, so they're fluid. So, we are going with planet drops for the characters that you've seen in the Discord. 

Each of those characters comes from a planet. Each planet has 23 characters. And we want to roll out planets– in the future. 

This one would be; Core 1 Planet Drop.

You can assume that we'll drop more planets in the future. 

Those would be: Core Drop 2 or 3 (down the road)

I'll let Al take this over. He will talk about some of the progress made on some of the characters and the planets.

### Planet Drops & Comics (Getting Close)

**Al:** Right now, we are pretty much ready to show you guys all the characters. I've already shown some of the heads of a few by uploading the Emojis in the Discord. You can check them out by looking at our server  Emojis. 

That's only around one-third of the characters. There are so many it would be overwhelming for me to try and post them all in the Discord and show everyone. So, for a fair amount of them, we'll have to wait for the NFTs to release to see them all. 

But, every character... It's the same as the comics– there are too many to display. There will be a ton of them. At first, I was the only writer but, now we've had a ton of pick-up from the community to write them. Other people who want to be a part of this are good writers.  

Some of them have good credibility. A few have even helped with [Adult Swim](https://www.adultswim.com/) shows and other projects like that. Things that I forget right now. I also don't want to say something wrong.

Anyway, some great writers have got on board to help write. So now the comics are going to be sick!

So, now the comics will be sick, and the first drop will be somewhat of a 'test.'

A lot of the comics will be all over the place– it will all connect– but they are all wrote in different ways with varying themes. They'll have different stories that come out. 

It will be quite exciting when a new comic comes out by a different writer. You'll be able to tell it's their style. I hope that whatever comics do the best and whichever ones the community enjoys most– we continue off with those character stories mainly and focus on them. 

But, we do want to extend the overall lore of every species either way. There will be lore for everything– this will happen over time. It's not something that we can release instantly. Some things will need to gets held off, and we'll have to wait for specific stories to release before others get thought about. 

About five writers are working on this specifically. And others are helping– some of the devs want to help– and cartoon artists. We have artists who draw the comics and artists who come up with ideas for the comics. 

So, it's all slightly clashing, and everyone's helping one another. The whole lore will be super-developed because of all the teamwork involved. It'll be fun to get into as a viewer. It's something that you can pretend you are in– a little bit of an escape from reality in a way. You can be in this 'Universe' and own characters from it. Hopefully, we can add more utility, and you can use these characters somewhere. 

We don't have any ideas for a game. But, there doesn't have to be a game coded into the characters. It's something that the community can develop externally. The possibilities for all the characters are endless.

I won't speak on the other drops, this drop seems to be our main drop, but it isn't. We'll have other Core Drops that are super dope, besides this one. 

**Mark:** Yeah, we want to build out a lot of the lore. All of the drops when they are cool enough, and people are excited about it. Then we want to build it out. Al did a great job of explaining what has happened over the last few weeks.

There was a decent amount of outrage from the community, especially after becoming more active. There were a few months of silence for everyone. 

Some of the announcements erupted in the community–it got many people excited– and a large number of people reached out wanting to help. Al has almost built a war team of people from the community. They now help write the lore of this Universe. As he said, we have Adult Swim writers who are helping with this. 

They're even helping us understand what it takes to build a world. We hopped on a call with those writers this week, and they were asking us questions about this that we never even thought about. 

Like, what's the currency of the Universe? What are the religions? What's this and that. 

We didn't have complete answers for them. So, they said they'll help with all of that. It helped us realize that we did not know shit about making a world. These guys will help us out with that. They'll help us hammer down and create an immense and complete Universe that's not missing anything.  It should have every aspect that we can explore. 

Like Al said, ideally, down the road, we can build metaverse style things. Or build out utilities for the NFTs, so they get used in games and Cryptovoxel type worlds. (metaverses)

**Tyler:** Where did those guys come from? The Workaholics guy and the Tokemak/Fractal dude?

**Mark:** So Ders ([Anders Holm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Holm)) from [Workaholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaholics) is one of our contributors. He knows a bunch of comedy writers. Their names are [Davram](https://twitter.com/davramdavram) and [Jason](https://twitter.com/jasonselvig) their from a group called [The Good Liars.](https://twitter.com/TheGoodLiars) 

They are somewhat famous on TikTok. I think they have around a million followers. They also have a large following on Twitter and Youtube.
They're [Adult Swim](https://www.adultswim.com/) writers, and they helped with all sorts of large productions and shows. 

I believe Les is trying to get me in touch with one of the co-writers for Rick and Morty– to see if we can get him to help with some of the lore. 

As I said, it's been very crazy with all the outreach from the community, and you know, the resumes of some of the people who want to help are awesome. I want to say we have 'experts' reaching out. Trying to help us build out these worlds. 

It's very exciting. 

### Polymorphic Universe [[24:10]](https://youtu.be/_0YsbpMqF4E?t=1450)

**Mark:** This week, I released an article detailing some of the big announcements, and there is some information about the new NFTs. There was also a little teaser on our "Drop 2" which is called Polymorphic Universe. So, we want to dive into this a little bit.

We want to get everyone thinking about this. I believe It's going to be a huge hit. 

- **Overview:**

  - There are 15 characters that you can get. 

- **How Polymorphs work:** 

  - You can mint a character, and you are randomly given 1/15 of the characters. 

  - They come with a range of items, weapons and all sorts of random things. 

   - Ex; Hats, glasses etc. 

The list isn't finished. But, we are working on making a bunch of items interchangeable and mixable between characters.

- **How the items work:**

   - The items have a genetic strain attached. Which is allowed to morph/change/mutate on command.

   - You can tell it when and how. You'll pay a small amount of Ether to make the mutation happen. 


From there, you can attempt to get a certain level of rarity. It's completely random– the genetic strain, what you'll get and how it will mutate. 

We're also looking at options to control mutations or pick traits. We're still exploring some of the possibilities around how the NFTs morph. 

I'll be releasing an article this week about some of the drop dynamics. How drops will function and work. 

We'll be leaking some of the NFTs in that article. So, stay tuned to our [Medium](https://medium.com/universe-xyz/) for that.

> In case you missed it: [Birth of the Universe](https://medium.com/universe-xyz/the-birth-of-the-universe-ad3aa85dfa10)

I believe we've covered the main topics. I don't want to give away too much information about the Polymorphic Universe. Because that's still mid-creation, and we're working on getting that finished still. I think it's close enough that we can release some information about it. So everyone can start getting excited about it. 

It seems like everyone in the community is very excited right now. We have yield farming live. Next Monday warm-up period starts. NFTs are in the pipeline, ready to drop. Auction contracts are getting audited. 

Everything seems to be in full motion. We're ready. Tyler's in Puerto Rico, and Troy's having the time of his life. 

Dragos has an amazing shirt on! 🌺👕

Like, life is good. It's time to have this Universe boom!

## Community Questions [[27:22]](https://youtu.be/_0YsbpMqF4E?t=1642) ❓

**Mark:** One other thing we have to do is go over community questions. I don't want to forget about the community questions. 

Let me hop in the Discord quickly. 

Okay, we don't have a ton of questions. 

It looks like since we released the docs, a lot of people's questions were answered. 

It looks like our only question is about learning a little bit more about the social components of the platform.

I believe I can answer that fairly quickly. I can give a general idea about our mission for the social platform. 

In my opinion, NFTs are a very social thing. You want to able to show them off, talk about them. And you want to be able to share ideas with those that have similar thoughts as you.

So, although NFTs are already a network and a social thing, we feel like the NFT space itself lacks a social media tool within the ecosystem. 

We didn't want to build a strict social media tool because we believe that a few of these tools, like OpenSea and Rarible– are already close. 

Why not add social media to these tools?  

Having tools inside of tools. For example, liking NFTs,  sharing NFTs and having the ability to create discussions around NFTs. We want to opt for our version of a social media aspect– similar to Reddit. It's like a discussion forum, and maybe some of the conversations you can't join. Because you don't have a Cryptopunk, and they want Cryptopunk holders to hold discussions. At a higher Cryptopunk-level. Rather than having unwanted people popping into the conversation and posting random content in the thread.  

Also, the gallery features, Facebook and Instagram, are clever tools for sharing and posting NFTs. 

However, why are there no NFT galleries that promote the more social aspect of them? 

It doesn't make much sense to us. So, this is something we want to tackle. It's not the main component of what we want to achieve. We look at Universe as a whole, as a social tool, because that's what NFTs are. They are a social tool that can get a conversation going. 

You can tell when someone shares interests with you if you share the same art. It's a curious economy. I'd say– NFTs themselves– they are a social thing. 

We think that social media is necessary for this. We want to hear what the community thinks about this and what you want from an NFT social media platform. We don't want to be the only people curating and pulling this in the right direction. 

We definitely want outreach on social media as much as we've had for helping create the lore. I know everyone sits around and says they wish OpenSea had this tool or that functionality. We don't mind you guys throwing up suggestions. Honestly, we are out there hammering and working on so much stuff for this. That it's sometimes hard for us to take a break and think ahead. 

If you guys can be thinking ahead and doing research for us. Asking us or even brainstorming with us. We want this to be a community project– it is – but we want it to be community-run. We are open to hearing what the community has to say. 

So, let us know. 

Via the **#xyz-ideas** channel in our Discord. 

If you read that, we interact in there. We want to hear yall's ideas– so bring 'em! 

I think that wraps up everything for today unless anyone else has anything to say?

### Intro: [Cris Garner](https://twitter.com/crisgarner)

Shoutout to Cris Garner. He's been trying to get on these calls for six weeks now, and he's finally on one. 

I don't know if everyone knows Cris. But, Cris, do you want to introduce yourself because this is your first project call. 

**Cris:** Hello, guys! Can you hear me?

**Mark:** We can hear!

**Cris:** Okay, cool. 

Yeah, I was having issues with the timezone and every time I went to hop into the calls, it was already done. So, I had to watch the recording. 

My name is Cristian Espinoza. I live in Honduras. I've been working behind the shadows because I could never join the calls. I'm a Smart contract developer. I would say that I'm more full-stack stuff. Mostly, my experience is Smar contract development. 

I've launched a few contracts on mainnet. Last month I created some that were audited. So, I have some experience in the DeFi space– developing stuff. Of course, farming and doing cool things with NFTs that I love. 

That's how I joined this project– by having a deep love for NFTs.

**Mark:** Nice, man!

We really appreciate having you. Cris has been a lot of help. Honestly, as Cris said, he was one of the earliest supporters in the Discord, and we brought him on because we found out he's a Smart contract developer– and actually, a pretty damn good one. 

So, we're happy to have Cris on the team. 

I think that's everything for the day. So, remember to hit like and subscribe!

Share with you frens!

Follow us on Twitter and Medium. And join our Discord!

Also, remember, if you were in the Discord in February, go into the #xyz-airdrop channel and post your address!

Do it! It's important.

4000 people eligible!

**Al:** Make sure it's a Metamask Ethereum address and not an exchange address.

**Mark:** Yes, you don't want to post an exchange address. And if anyone has posted one in there. If you would like to update your wallet address, you would redo the command.

!address + 0x...

And it will update your airdrop address with the one you most recently posted.

**Zhivko:** I think Dragos has something to say about Metamask. 

**Mark:** Kill the fox?

**Dragos:** It's like...yeah...no...yes...

No comment here.

**Mark:** Alright, everyone! 

Hit like, subscribe and all the stuff!

See you in two weeks!

**Everyone:** ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
