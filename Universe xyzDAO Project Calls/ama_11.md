## Intro 

**Mark:** I'm going to go ahead and start and say that we released a DAO Vote. It's in the warm-up period. We voted that we've been working on an internal drop with a few external NFT Artists. We had some people on our team, and some outside artists come in and help us. 

We owe 9 of the artists some money, and we wanted to pull it out of the Polymorph funds because this is a polymorphic derivative. These are the Polymorphic Faces. Some people have seen some pictures online over the last few months of us tweeting some of them, and Clown Charles's faces are part of that. Soon enough, we'll start leaking more images of how those NFTs will look. But we're very happy with it, and it was honestly a cool collaborative effort. Not everybody participated in what we had found. We had enough participation in making the project work out. Our internal artists also helped because they were the people who initially did the Polymorph designs.

We need to vote to release those funds. Tomorrow, that vote will go live, but that money will go to a hot wallet that I have control over, and I'm going to distribute those funds. Then we're going to refund a team member who paid one of the artists early because the artist had requested it. Instead of going through a whole download process, we had someone payout of their wallet. We'll refund those people, give all those transactions to the community, and send any remaining funds back to the DAO. There's a little bit extra for gas. But we wanted to explain what that vote is about. We did get the community feedback in the Discord today about the vote. We have noted your feedback, and we will have an internal discussion about how we move forward on refunding them for projects that we've already done. 

## Marketplace Support; Additional ERC20's [[02:54]](https://youtu.be/MHt6NGk1ST4?t=174) üß∞

**Mark:** One big thing brought up by the community that I think the team also wants to address is the opportunity to add ERC 20s to support the Marketplace. Aaron McDonald originally came up with mentioning APE token and ASTO. If you allow Bored Ape users to use that token on the Marketplace, that can bring listings, liquidity and buyers to the Marketplace.

We have already started a forum discussion. If Zach wants to go ahead and post that forum discussion in the Pre AMA channel. We should start having conversations, and we can do monthly or bi-monthly pushes‚Äî where we push 10 to 20 tokens. 

Axie Infinity has a great community and the Altered State Machines, Sandbox, Decentraland. It's an excellent idea, and there are cool reasons why. We can figure out down the road, what to do with the DAO vote, and what to do with the fees. It's a cool idea to start adding tokens sooner than later because adding tokens to the interface is not very hard.

**Tyler:** It also gives us the opportunity. I've seen that the Floor App has a well-balanced treasury that isn't in USDC, ETH, and XYZ. I'm long-term excited about this industry in general. There are things that we'll be able to do with this. It opens up tons of opportunities for what we could do with entertainment. Imagine streaming or renting NFTs and pretty much any currency. It attracts all of those ecosystem partners into our ecosystem. Certain aspects of it could even help. From a tax perspective, let's say that I had offers in Illuvium, and I had offers in ETH, but I was planning on selling the ETH to buy Illuvium for an NFT that I wanted to sell. It's just fewer transactions. 

So long-term, we need to be cognizant of when people put those random tokens in your wallet that can rug your whole wallet from a security perspective. We can't enable all ERC 20s, or someone will get rugged and call us out. 

We are in the middle of talking about a capacity to use the snapshot votes to honour collections that we want to see added. 

If the community has a list of collections, I know you only need to have 1% of the token supply to set up a DAO. You only need a low amount to set up a snapshot. Anyone who has the XYZ token can set up snapshots to add collections that will get prioritized by the scraper. All collections will be showing up in the long-term, but you don't have to get verified by the team. We have to be a little more careful to add all ERC 20 tokens as a community. Someone could introduce a network security issue into the platform. For now, if we're adding a bunch of tokens that we support. I don't see there being an issue. When we have 100 or 200 ERC 20 currencies that you can select from‚Äî we need to keep security in mind.

**Mark:** I think we start more towards trusted DeFi tokens like AAVE & SNX. We'll mainly focus on the NFT communities.

I know there are NFT tokens that we should be looking to integrate with, like Sandbox, Illuvium and obviously the Bored Ape Club token. The super-powerful thing that Tyler just mentioned is that it allows us to build this reserve of these tokens, and then we can decide what to do with all of it as a community. Even going back to what Tyler said on the DAO voting. Some of the other tokens are governance tokens, and our DAO could earn 1% of Illuvium supply and then be able to create a proposal, which is the long-term goal. That's long-term thinking here. I don't know if everyone realizes what the long-term of what we're talking about right now is, but that's it. That's why XYZ token holders would be in control of that.

I can hand it off to Ryan to go over the Marketplace priorities and stuff we've been going over. We released that medium article this past Monday and gave some updates on Twitter and Discord. We'll try to do that every Monday or Tuesday so that everyone knows what we're working on and they can expect what's to come. 

**Ryan:** Two days ago, we released an update with stuff that Mark laid out very nicely in the article. There are a bunch of fixes there. We have another sprint coming up with further improvements to the leisure and updates to the scraper. We're improving the unique collections that don't have standard metadata because other Marketplaces can aggregate it from OpenSea. They don't have to build the legends for every single NFT. We do have that position. We are building everything ourselves and rolling out our own. So every new token has a weird quirk. One perfect example of this is HashMask. 

Hashmask is a token that everybody knows about; it doesn't follow the usual 721 standards. So we're working on rule engines for tokens like Hashmasks and Axies and other tokens. So that's going to be exciting.

Along with the improvements in speeding up the scraper itself, both in how fast it can process going backwards and the monitoring capabilities. Some bugs are being fixed on that side in terms of the owner accounts. I know we've had some issues and improvements we are working on with the volume traded and the floor prices to attempt to include ER 20 tokens. That will probably not be in this next upcoming feature, at least. There are features on the board, bug fixes, and general improvements. There's a larger undertaking with things like the order migration from OpenSea and Looks Rare and other platforms. Mark, if you have anything you want me to get into specifics, I can give more details. But at a high level, fixing bugs on all points and then doing everything we can to ensure that we can get this as scalable as possible before the alpha release.

**Mark:** I don't think we need to dive into anything else much deeper. I'll just follow-up and mention a few more things. We are working on 1155 support. We are close to getting the filter by trade filtering up, and we are working as hard as we can to get the search all refactored. The search will take us some time to fix and test completely. The traitor filter by trait is going to come sooner than expected.

**Ryan:** Yes. They're both short-term and long-term approaches. One is to work on those very specific traits, but then another to optimize general terms against hundreds of thousands and then millions and then tens of millions of NFTs as the collections grow.

**Mark:** I think we can hop into the forum where the questions are. 

## Forum & Pre AMA Questions [[13:37]](https://youtu.be/MHt6NGk1ST4?t=817) ‚ÅâÔ∏è

### **Question: JD Buffalo** ‚ùì

What specifically are the dev team‚Äôs priorities right now in terms of functionalities and fixes? What is the timeframe to roll these out? 

If that‚Äôs not completely clear, are we talking 1-2 weeks? 1-2 months?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Chuba recently answered a lot of this. 

Some of these fixes will take 1 to 2 weeks. Some of these fixes are going to take 1 to 2 months. We are trying our best to gauge timelines on all of them. We fixed some of these issues before we gauge a timeline, but we're trying to figure that out and be as transparent as possible. The hardest part is about the development process, we know a general estimate, but we could run into another bug and extend another week.

**Ryan:** Yes, I will say that the feature requests coming from the community are the ones we prioritize. And when you guys point out things that may be confusing or not as intuitive as you like it. We're doing our best to do rapid redesigns. So, there is more clarity on some of the features and a little bit less confusion. All feedback there helps, and we're doing those things as quickly as possible, especially if it comes up 2, 3 or 4 times; it becomes a high priority ticket quickly.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Which members of the team are directly involved in development, and which are not? 

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** I made a couple of the devs team members in the Discord. Naple is a dev. Mad Breaks was a community member who came on and took a full-time back-end developer role in the past month. 

Those are people I see on here having a green role. I added two additional devs. We do use contract developers that Aaron and I have worked with for a very long time out of New Zealand, and they work with developers in both Singapore and China. There are numerous people on the Lime Chain team who are full-time. Lime Chain is a big organization with 70 to 80 devs.

**Mark:** I think we have 8 or 9 from Lime Chain.

**Tyler:** Some of them work in entertainment. The devs who are on our team from [Lime Chain], like [Iliya](https://twitter.com/Iliya49403116), is a Project manager/developer. He's a very technical project manager. We also have [Vic](https://twitter.com/vikk_todorov), Stery, and Stan.

**Mark:** [George](https://twitter.com/GSpasov) from Lime Chain contributes a ton. We have different teams that are building. But that's what decentralization is about too. We didn't just have 1 team working even before DMob‚Äî they eventually left.

**Tyler:** There's also Boris from Lime Chain. Numerous people are not even part of Lime Chain devs, like Ryan (Chuba), Reid, and Paul, a back-end developer. 

A guy named John came up from the community and he's helping build Temple. These people are full-time on Universe. I just named 10 Full-Time Developers who only work on Universe. Tim, a co-founder, is a smart contract developer, and he's not compensated directly from Universe. Like me, he doesn't take a salary, but he banged out the entire raffle component of the auctions in a weekend. 

I'm putting in full-time hours on this, and Troy helps a ton. Everything regarding architecture. Development isn't just writing code; it's also going through and figuring out what we need to build. Organizing everything, resources, and hiring developers. I would say we have a much more well-oiled machine right now than we've had at any point in the history of Universe. 

These blockchain projects have 1 or 2 Devs that do most of the work. This is a much bigger project and endeavour.

**Mark:** I don't think we even mentioned Chuba. Chuba freaking does everything and Trevor.

**Tyler:** We didn't mention Trevor. Trevor does all of our systems and DevOps; he came up originally through the Barnbridge community. Some developers are listening to this that don't think that we listen to the community, or they believe this is some secret club. Ryan (Chuba), Trevor, Reid, and John came up through the community. Those Lime Chain Devs have explicitly requested to work on Universe. If there are talented people in the community, reach out to us. 

We always need talented people.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What are the non-dev guys focusing their efforts on? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We have different roles. A DAO is an organization. So you have people that do all sorts of stuff. We have many project managers and other projects going on under the hood. On the art side, we have 15 Artists and 6 Project Managers. We have a support team with about 3 to 4 people. Everyone's busy.

**Tyler:** It's like NFT creation. So the Polymorphic Faces are big projects. People have to manage them. There's UI/UX‚Äî Nick has been working on Temple with John and the front-end developer that works with John. I think his name is Alexey. I didn't even mention all of the front-end devs. Like feature requests, Rayne is killing it on a lot of the community support. Zach is helping a ton with everything across the entire board. 

**Mark:** Everyone has been testing the Marketplace when everyone has free time. We're constantly testing new features, and everything has been audited. That is also why it took time to get some of this stuff out. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Is there a serious thought amongst the team to re-work the tokenomics? 

If so, are there contributors (from the website) you feel comfortable reaching out to in order to help?

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** The best tokenomics in the world will not change the fact that everyone knows that there are things that need to be fixed in the Marketplace. 

We need to roll it out and make those fixes. Yes, we could reach out to people on the contributor's list; those people reach out to me when they're doing their tokenomics for their project. I'm not trying to shrug that off. We have capable people in the community to introduce new tokenomics. I'm completely redoing a bunch of the tokenomics for Barnbridge, but there are concerns. We're an American team, and we're a doxed. We can't do the same things as other projects, and that's not music to the ears of people who hold the token. That doesn't mean American projects aren't good. This is going to be a multi-year process. Regulators are going to have to come on to it. I'm not going to vote for something when all my friends work around this protocol to do short-term beneficial but long-term damages to the project because it puts us in a bucket that we don't want to be in.

I've talked to lawyers and the community about tokenomics. It's not coding them that's the issue. All American DeFi and NFT projects probably need to pay more attention to some regulatory concerns. There are massive bills on the floor of Congress that major Congresspeople are saying that they're proposing. Some of those things are part of what I'm waiting for before release. I don't want to release some revamped tokenomics, and we spend the time coding it, and then a floor gets introduced in Congress. It just says Americans can't do this. People may think that we can hide behind our non-roles, but we can't. Even the addons can't do that. You could subpoena GitHub. So I'm not trying to be a jerk about it, but the ideas that people are asking to do are illegal. Just because other projects are doing it doesn't necessarily mean that they're not going to get in trouble or aren't going to be damaged from that. That's just the unfortunate truth.

I'm not trying to upset anyone, but I want this project to exist in 10 years, and doing things in the short term to pump the price is not a long-term strategy. Tokenomic regulations aside, it's not a good idea.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What is the current strategy for a complete rollout when the Marketplace gets there? If that's when we can expect more of a marketing push, where does that marketing effort stand today? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** The short answer is that we have released about 10% to 15% of what we have built over the last year. 


Hopefully, we will roll out 100% of it in the next three months. I think we'll be able to have all of it published. The devs will probably try and kill me, but we have the stuff to bring out, and we will roll it out in steps. I've said this every week. To build a scalable product in a way, you have to build it in stages. You can release it all at once, but it's a nightmare to find out what breaks if something breaks. If we can release things step by step or a few things at a time, and we know that stuff isn't going to break or isn't going to overload our site entirely and make the NFT load speed super slow. It's a scalability thing that we know our back-end will be able to handle. If we need to improve, we will, so we don't have critical issues where the site goes down, and people can't trade their NFTs.

**Tyler:** The other thing is, when I bring up tokenomics, I would say that listing incentives are not what I'm talking about in that bucket. Once we have rolled something out that everybody thinks is mainstream ready. The number one thing that some of them are simple. The fact that I can't filter by trade. 

We don't need to be incentivizing a bunch of listings when people can't do that on the Marketplace yet. I would like to see 1155 implemented. I got a DM from the guys from Boys Noise. It was either Boys Noise or Disclosure, but they wanted us to add Rave Pigs because they saw the vote that we were putting the Mfers in. Ryan checked the contract, and Rave Pigs are 1155, so we could open ourselves to where people say first impressions are everything. 1% of the NFT market has not seen Universe yet, and 1% of the people who will use NFTs in the coming years have never even bought an NFT yet. 

We are still very early, and it's not a dead project walking.

The back-end is unbelievable. We've been working with groups. Last night I was up till 11:00 p.m, working on a go-to-market strategy on how we can deal with some of the inbound interests from major brands. When I say major brands, I'm talking like household name companies that have reached out to us and want to integrate our Marketplace because it's permissionless, the team is doxxed, and because of all the reasons that the tokenomics can't be what looks are. What we build is something that these groups can plug into. 

We're trying to develop a way‚Äî we're not a services company. How do we make these front ends and document them very well? That's one-way long-term. 

You get long-tail assets and many listings on the Marketplace by building custom Marketplaces for huge brands. I'm going to use a brand that we haven't talked to. Reebok, just as an example, Reebok doesn't want to send their people to Universe or send their people to OpenSea. They want it on their site to show that these are verified Reebok NFTs, and they want to know that the system works properly.

Our front-end is not as important as this massive conglomerate of front ends that will plug into us long-term. That's a huge win for us that these brands even 1 knows about us. Two are paying attention and what we built is premium to some of the things on the market. That will most likely require us to do something like finders fees, where now Reebok hypothetically, could build an interface plug into Universe, and then they make money when things sell, and we make money when items sell, and we make money off of these volume plays. We also need to incentivize listings because we can't just wait years and years of all the interfaces that plug into us. We need to get listings on the Marketplace in a sustainable way. Everything doesn't just get swept by Gem or Genie, and we have to keep doing it every month. These are multi-pronged approaches that will bring value to Universe long-term. We need to get some of our front-end situated before going after these larger opportunities.

Like a two-pronged bucket, one is getting site listings, and two are building interfaces for custom groups. 

Anyone can start a company and build interfaces for groups in Universe. You don't need our permission or stamp of approval. That's one of the powers of Universe. There could be entire industries built around what we've created. I don't think enough people realize that yet. 

**Mark:** We've been talking to the JPEG kids originally about this.

**Tyler:** That's when we introduced it or started talking about it. One of the reasons we delayed the Marketplace a couple of days was to ensure that all we would need was a vote and a contract upgrade to introduce a finder's fee. But I've talked to Andy at Fractional, and that finders fee is why he's interested in building a custom Marketplace that he can just put on Fractional. We often talk about the Charged Particles guys. There's no reason they couldn't do that. I'm talking with FLUFs and Aaron about doing a custom marketplace.

**Mark:** I even talked to the OpenSea team in Austin, Texas. They mentioned that if Universe were doing a finders fee, they would be interested in plugging into our back-end because it's extra revenue and sales.

**Tyler:** I can tell you that one of the largest tech companies worldwide reached out to us and likes this specifically more than OpenSea. 

We need the scraper to be complete. I can't be going out and selling this to another hypothetical company because I'm not going to say the real one, we have to get this thing ready. We need another 60 days to get everything properly before we go courting kings. But the interest is there, and those people on the website are not fake. We're very connected and know people in the world. We know people in the industry. We have friends in low places and friends in high places, and we're going to tap those people when we feel it's appropriate. I think everyone in this community is in that same boat. We're all early NFT people. Every person on this call, their family probably thinks of them as the person who knows a bunch about NFTs, and their friends tax them about NFTs. Well, that's the Cascades up to celebrities, down to your next-door neighbour.

So when this thing gets right, I think it's going to be on all of us to spread the gospel.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Should we do any type of marketing to gain users? Should we wait until we are fully fleshed out or ready to be considered out of beta? 

Or wait until the scraper does all the scraping necessary before we even consider marketing incentivization push? How far away are we from all of that? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I mentioned a timeframe earlier on this call.

**Tyler:** It's hard to estimate. Punks are enormous, right? 

The Punks took our scraper multiple days because of all the data on-chain. When we add 1155, that's another task for the scraper, and every time, a new collection gets added. We're also doing many back-end architecture changes because we had a Dev Team turnover when we were building this. So some of the back-ends are in MongoDB, and a lot of the back-end is in Postgres. We need to pick one or the other and ensure that everything is happening. It's not even really the back-end; it's more the database in this scenario. It's hard to estimate how long the scraper will take to scrape everything, there are multiple collections a day, and some of them take longer than others. 

The short answer is that the scraper will never be done minting or scraping because every single transfer, every new NFT collection, is picking all of that up. So the scraper is working both forward-looking and retroactive-looking.

When gas fees are high and many mints are happening, it's picking that stuff up. Like things showed up on Universe faster than they showed up on other Marketplaces. When they changed the actual art, it happened slower in our Marketplace. There are different functions the back-end and the database are doing, and we're honing all of those functions. Our back-end in our database is more scrapable than the other Marketplaces, but right now, we're the youngest Marketplace on the entire market, and it will take some time. I can't give you an answer that's not vague. I'm just giving you all the reasons the answer is vague. ü§ù

### **Question: JD Buffalo** ‚ùì

There has been some back and forth about a potential airdrop to other marketplaces users? I was just curious what the thinking is here? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I know there was a bit of back and forth a while ago. 

We need to decide that as a community. We've had this question before. The team is all for it. We need to figure out a way to make it fair and not gameable and ensure the people we're rewarding will use our Marketplace. We don't want to incentivize everybody, just people who come to our Marketplace. 

We've had conversations about that and the best way to do it. We should open it up to the community and see what we can come up with together. At this point, we're building together. The point of opening up this beta was that we could build this thing together. Everyone should feel like they had the opportunity to build it with us.

**Tyler:** We are not just sitting in some castles in Europe not working. 

Since its release, everyone can see that we're way more active in the Discord. We're talking with the community. We're taking into account everything everyone is saying. I get many DMs from people who ask things they may not want to ask in the main threads. 

[Knowledgeable Idiot](https://twitter.com/raynemang) put all of that stuff together for community empowerment, and we're going to keep rolling that stuff out. 

> [Community Center](https://clowncharles.notion.site/clowncharles/Universe-Community-Center-9e4043a8e6844769be26032bfe089baa)

This is a community-run project, and when we get on calls, everyone on the team starts with concerns of the community that are red flags. If something's on fire, we hear it from the community. We're listening. Sometimes the ideas are helpful because we see things and think that's pretty clever. I've noticed that in FLUFs. People make up the lore. We should do that because it's a good idea. Your opinions and your voices are heard, and they matter. 

Having people and many brains contributing to this project makes it more powerful. We continue to do what we're doing. I know that people are looking at the token price and worry about where things are. Some things are going on in the world that affects those things. The team isn't going to do anything to affect the token price. The Marketplace is in a good spot. The fact that the community is actively engaged after an entire year, many projects would have lost people. That's a testament to the community. 

**Mark:** I think you mean the Seekers, not the Thingies we did, the metadata release.

**Tyler:** I keep saying Thingies‚Äî by accident.

**Mark:** Sometimes you got to do what you got to do and work 24/7 in crypto as Tyler does. ü¶æ

**Tyler:** I know we've been on this for a year, but any software that gets released, even if you spend a year building, it will have bugs, it's going to have kinks, and there will be features that need to get added late/last minute. 

I appreciate everyone's patience right now, and then outside of that, we're listening. This stuff getting written goes into repositories when people write into the support desk. We talk about this type of stuff on calls and what we prioritize. I didn't think 1155 was that big of a deal to be added from the get-go. I know Ryan pushed for that, and that's been one of the main things the community, both in the Discord and even externally, Twitter has been requesting. That's getting prioritized specifically because people around the ecosystem ask for it. Ryan was right, and we are prioritizing that, but you can't snap your fingers and have that added. It takes time, but we're close.

**Mark:** It looks like we're out of questions.

**Tyler:** I saw something cool; there's a developer that works at, I think, [Paradigm](https://twitter.com/paradigm), one of the big VCs, and he spent last night writing code for token curated GitHub Repos. 

I think there would be ways we can introduce that into Universe. One way Troy talked about was even putting the source code around the database, the APIs and documentation behind something token curated by the XYZ token. This means you have to own a certain amount of XYZ even to see the registry. This means these larger companies that want to plug into our Marketplace would have to buy XYZ. This came up today that I shared within groups, and we have ideas bouncing around. Some of how we curate the collection and what we do with Temple. That's one of the cooler things I've seen in the last 3 months.

The cryptos were the concept around token gated source code, where the license is open source, but you can only see it if you own the token. We can do creative things with that as a community, which I haven't talked about. It's a cool idea since we're talking about tokenomics because it is a type of tokenomics that is completely legal, and I don't think it would raise anybody's eyebrows. 

It's a cool implementation of cryptographic assets and digital assets.


## NFT Display [[47:10]](https://youtu.be/MHt6NGk1ST4?t=2831) üì∫

**Troy:** I want to bring up was the NFT display. I don't know if anyone's noticed this, but we are getting ready to start opening up the application for beta testing. But we need people using Universe because it uses the Universe back-end, and it uses your profile on Universe. There is a channel it's under Graviton. It's like the NFT display; the mobile app and the actual TV app should be going into beta in the next couple of weeks. If you want to sign up for that, you should drop a DM in the NFT display.

We have people in here, and we're actually

**Tyler:** Troy, you should tell them what it is. You know it because you're working so much on that. But I don't know if we're on one of these calls.

**Mark:** Yeah, we don't talk about a lot of the [Graviton](https://graviton.xyz).

**Troy:** We can start talking about it because we are getting ready to start releasing it.

One of the things is that Graviton did release a new website. You guys can go there and check it out. It's at Graviton.XYZ. 

We break down some of the services and products that we are getting ready to launch. One of the first products we will launch is an NFT display application. So what it does is we were looking for an easy way to show our NFTs that we own on television or any display out there that can either have an Apple TV connected to it or a Chromecast little device connected to it. What you do is log into the Graviton website. It will pull up all your NFTs connected to your Universe profile. You then can add your NFTs to a playlist, and that playlist then gives you a code. You then can put the code into the mobile app, and that mobile app will play it, or you can put it into the television app. It will play the playlist of your NFTs on your television or your mobile app or whatever you have it connected to.

That's going to be the first probably application product that we drop. We also will have another product called NFT Storage which will allow you to make sure that you can always backup all of your NFTs that you own in a decentralized manner. People probably don't know this, but many NFTs are located on OpenSeas's back-end. But the problem is that because it's on OpenSeas back-end, it's not backed up anymore on IPFS. We're going to have an easy way for any user out there to ensure that no matter what happens if OpenSea goes down or anything crazy happens, you guys will always have an easy way to back up all your NFTs. It's a free service for now, but we have ways to incentivize monetization. The other two huge things we're working on are Xenon and Hadron. We had to rename a lot of this stuff because we ran into a ton of Copyright issues; as a company, we have to follow that stuff. 

Xenon is a pay-as-you-go streaming service for videos, I will leave it at that, but it's going into beta testing in a month.

If you guys want to sign up for that, we'll probably open that up. The other thing is called Hadron, which is an art patronage system. So what it is, is what Tyler was talking about a token gateway into repositories. This will be a token gateway into specialized siloed art that Artists put on the internet in a back-end that we control. There are other things we're doing with that that are going to plug back into Universe. Both these things plug back into Universe long-term. 

For Xenon, we are working on a transcoding pool. So that if you are providing transcoding power to the Xenon application for streaming, you will be mining XYZ token, which I think is pretty cool. Then for Hadron, it's going to plug into the Universe. How should I say this...It's going to plug into Hadron in a very unique way; I don't have an easy way of saying it, so I'm going to leave it at that. But there are plans of using much interest. We'll use Universe minting very specific way, and that's how we're going to leave it.

**Tyler:** I know what you're trying to say. I would just keep that as alpha for now. üòº

**Troy:** I'm not going to drop too much. There are also a couple of other things that we're working on with Graviton, but that will probably drop pretty quickly. Still, it's all happening underneath the hood for specific reasons, so just be on the lookout for that. But there will be a ton of really cool stuff, and I think it will make people who have XYZ tokens very happy.

**Tyler:** I want to add about Graviton in general; we took grants from the DAO or the Multi SIG because what we're building now supports and enhances Universe. Troy has been in the media and blockchain before NFT was something people even thought about. What we're building has been talked about and ideated for multiple years at the end of the day. Everybody calls [Kaiyn](https://twitter.com/kaiynne) the godfather of Yield Farming. Kaiyn even borrowed from some of the media protocols that were doing innovative things at the time. We have raised a separate round where Graviton is a privately funded company, which is beneficial in 2 respects. It extends the runway of Universe because it allows us to split out those resources that we've built specifically for Graviton. When we were doing this, Troy, Tim and I and the team have seen success and run things ethically; we had our pick on the types of investors we wanted to be involved in the project.

Mostly we're going to tap on people who have already been pretty involved in Universe. There's also the Barnbridge component because Graviton is in a holding company that also has a company that we're building stuff next to Barnbridge. So say Barnbridge and Universe seed contributors. There were two in particular that I wanted to be involved in a significant way that was strategic both for Graviton and Universe. And both of those groups have signed on to the round. We will have renewed interest from some of the larger institutional players in the space that have an old-world like Silicon Valley connections. 

During the process of us bringing them on, I found out that one of them is the 2nd or 3rd largest trader in volume on OpenSea, which was surprising to me because I knew of them as a DeFi group. But long story short, the larger groups in the space still pay attention to what we're doing. They understand code takes time, and they're doubling down on us. The project, the team, the protocol, the community, and everything happened up to this point.

These are sophisticated people, so that makes me excited and confident.

**Troy:** The best part about all that is their long-term vision people, and so they're not quick flippers of stuff, so they don't get out, and they don't leave projects until they feel they've reached their full vision. 

That should make everyone feel good because the vision of Universe and the vision of the services and everything built around it is huge, and it's not going to happen overnight. We're all here for the long haul, so know that the people supporting us are there for the same reasons. Also, sorry, the website for Graviton is down. Tyler just reminded me of that. We're doing some refactoring on the server, so probably check back tomorrow. It will be up. üßë‚Äçüíª

**Mark:** One more thing is that we are talking with our merch team tomorrow. I know many people got their [Degen Supply](https://www.degen.supply/) merch. 

We are working on some more designs, and we are working on exclusive NFT Polymorph Merch, and that stuff will be token gated. We're working with the merch team on that. We have a meeting this week with them, and we'll figure out more of that. 

We are bringing more merch, we got great feedback and already have new designs.

**Tyler:** Okay.

**Mark:** Does anybody else here have any questions or anything else they want to bring up? 

**Tyler:** We will try to keep these hard and stop at an hour. We just had some people reach out and complain that they're getting dragged out, and we get to the point that we're normally rambling at this stage of the call. Going forward, we're going to be strict on cutting it at an hour.

**Mark:** It looks like it's all Polymorph spam and ETH Lizards head-bopping.

**Tyler:** Polymorphs are never spam, but I hear you. 

**Mark:** True, they are never spam.

### Shoutout [ETH Lizards](https://twitter.com/ethlizards)

**Tyler:** Shout out to the ETH Lizards. I'm not a founder of that project. 

Just so you all know. I got a founders lizard for being a founder in the space close to the project, and I've consulted for them on DAO components. I like their team, and I have massive respect for [Kieran](https://twitter.com/KieranWarwick). 

I'll help him with whatever he needs. I'm no more of a founder of ETH Lizards than I am of Ethereum, or [Illuvium](https://twitter.com/illuviumio) would be a good example. I help them structure stuff. Ultimately, I bought lizards like everyone else, and I was given one that has [Barnbridge](https://barnbridge.com) on it, and I'm not going to sell that thing. That's what founder lizard means. I've seen people ask me if I'm going to incorporate the lizards and the Polymorphic Republic of Metaversia, and no, I mean, maybe, I don't know. I like the lizards. Perhaps we will, but that's not a Universe project, a Tyler, Mark or a Troy project.

**Mark:** But we like the lizards. 

Aly said; Thank you for existing Tyler so I could buy an ETH Lizard. ü¶é üéâ

**Tyler:** I love you guys. üíô

**Mark:** We like the lizards.
