## Intro [[00:00]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4Fjo08ReJM)

**Mark:** Hey everyone! Welcome to project call number 10! for Universe and xyzDAO. 

This is amazing. It has already been 20-weeks since we've started our project calls. Time is flying. 📅🛫

We'll go ahead and dive in on the updates over the last two weeks. 

## Polymorph Upgrades 🧫🦹 [[00:24]](https://youtu.be/H4Fjo08ReJM?t=24)

**Mark:** First and foremost. We've completed our first proposal and vote for the DAO. 

The proposal was created to raise the scramble prize, and we need to freeze the contracts to enact the changes required. (No one can scramble them right now— the cost to scramble is insanely high.)

You're not able to scramble them right now. We are starting to build a custom bridge to Polygon. It's not as simple as using their current ERC721 bridge. We need to do some work on that. 

The migration for the bridge is necessary for the games that we want to build and the metaverse that we want to have. (Using characters in a metaverse) 

It helps to have some of those assets on Polygon. Which is growing rapidly, and they're working on a lot of features like Polygon Studios. They are building unique tools that will help onboard a lot of people into these metaverses. Polygon makes it easier and cheaper to deploy/use this stuff. 

The game is a large reason why we moved. And another cool feature— once we move over to Polygon, the scrambles become much cheaper because you don't deal with an Ethereum gas fee.

There are tons of great reasons why we moved. It saves gas and creates more utility. It allows for your Polymorph to do more things.

I'll turn it over to Ryan for updates regarding the auctions and minting. We've been given updates on those over the last couple of weeks.

## Auctions and Minting 🥼⚗️ [[02:49]](https://youtu.be/H4Fjo08ReJM?t=169)

**Ryan:** Nice! Thanks, Mark!

I'm super excited about the Polymorph upgrades. I think I speak for everyone when I say that.

On the auctions and minting front, we've made a ton of excellent progress. The auction platform— as most of you know —is getting a good chunk rebuilt. Then it will get audited. 

The audits came back, and we're working through all of the suggestions that the auditors proposed. We're testing all the functionality with a test-net UI. So, there is a fair amount of testing getting done. 

Once we finish this round of audits, they'll send a new round. Ideally, there are fewer issues the next time. It continues like that until all of the problems get sorted.

Additionally, in light of recent events, with Poly network. And the major DeFi hacks we're seeing. We'll be reaching out to additional auditing firms to get as many eyes on the contracts as possible. 

While we are comfortable with the written code & we have really great developers. It never hurts to get more eyes on it. We still want to ensure that everyone's NFTs are as safe and secure as possible. 

We don't want any crazy big brain issues appearing that cause people to lose their funds, NFTs or anything like that. There's a lot of focus on testing and best auditing practices.

I wish I could give more feature updates. However, in reality, our biggest priority with the auctions is to get them out. To do that, we need to keep testing, and the auditors need to continue auditing. 

Mark, if you would like to jump into the rarity charts, that would be cool. 

**Mark:** Yeah, I can go over that.

I want to stress again. Just how critical audits in this space are. For a majority of our listeners, Tyler and Troy are founders of BarnBridge— which is DeFi. 

We have tons of new people in this space— they are into NFTs but are not familiar with DeFi —Audits are a somewhat new concept to some NFT buyers.

Audits are something that we have to do. We take audits very seriously. What we've learned at BarnBridge and various DeFi protocols over the years— security is super important.

Although DeFi is more so about handling money and NFTs are a different concept altogether. We don't want to lose NFTs the same way you lose money. Some people have very valuable NFTs.

**Tyler:** Right, like Punks!

You don't want them to be misplaced, you don't want the infrastructure underneath to collapse, and the images disappear. 

**Mark:** Or some other exploit that redirects your Punk to the wrong wallet when you try and transfer it. Because for some reason, our code was not flawless on the backside. It sucks that it has taken us a while to complete this. But, these are likely the most critical steps that we take over the next month. We need to do our due diligence. 

Everything needs to get done, audited and as many eyes as possible need to be on it. We're taking our time. Taking the proper steps and being cautious. We're near the finish line, so we need to make sure we cross our t's and dot our i's. Security is something we take very importantly— we'll continue this way. We don't want to be responsible for anyone losing NFTs or funds on our platform. 

## Polymorph Rarity Charts ⚖️ 📈 [[07:00]](https://youtu.be/H4Fjo08ReJM?t=420)

**Mark:** On a happier note! We're going to release the Polymorph rarity charts. We planned to release it in between the last two weeks. (as per the previous project call)

However, we ran into an issue, and we needed to work around some problems. Those have been reworked and fixed. Now we are doing some more testing into the weekend. Hopefully, the charts are up this weekend. 

They'll be up by Monday at the latest!

Our apologies for taking so long. It was a little more challenging than we had thought. We fixed the issues we ran into, and now we need to ensure everything is 100% with a bit of testing. Then we'll release the rarity charts.

Sorry that the Polymorph scrambling is frozen while we release the rarity charts. But we'll be turning that back on when we're done. It's a safety precaution. We don't want anyone using them while we're editing them and migrating them over. (as we said, security and safety are something we take very seriously)

There is a very important reason why we did this. The migration is necessary for the games and features we are building.

##  Polymorphic Faces 🧫🎭 [[09:02]](https://youtu.be/H4Fjo08ReJM?t=542)

**Mark:** Lastly, this will be a fairly quick call. We want to limit the amount of Alpha we are leaking. We've leaked a ton over the last week via Twitter and Discord.

We've been working on some burn-to-mint derivatives of Polymorphs. So, if you have a Polymorph right now, you'll be given the option to burn one of your Polymorphs for other derivatives of Polymorphs. Two versions that we are working on— 2D/3D. They will be more realistic-looking Polymorphs. Slightly video-gamey. However, it's not a 3D character. It's still a 2D image.  

We're also working on another concept called Polymorphic faces. It's an interesting project. We've been talking about it on Twitter and internally. I've personally reached out to some artists as well. We're looking for artists to do a collaborative burn-to-mint project.

You take a Polymorph, then burn it to receive an NFT that can also get scrambled.

But, it's an artistic face created by several different artists. They'll all draw a full face which gets scrambled with all the other faces. It establishes a singular piece that can then get mixed further— for specific traits.

Imagine if you took all of our faces and mixed them up into different sections for each of our faces. As an NFT, that can get scrambled. Maybe you can get a full Dragos face or a full Algernon face.

It's a cool idea to take various styles and artists and give them full expression. They all bring their style and create one giant piece of art. But, It's a conglomerate of 10-12 artists that have a hand in this cool picture. Since it can get scrambled, you can shoot for a full face or something more unique.

We have one artist named Space Renders, and he has a cool style. Say he draws three faces. You can try and scramble for a full face done by Space Renders. Or you can shoot for a mixture of the three faces he made. You can also mix the style of every artist.

So, it's a cool derivative of Polymorph. It will still use the Polymorph contract so you can scramble them. It's another cool idea for utilizing the Polymorph contract to create a collaborative art project. It also gives NFT artists more exposure, and maybe they get noticed by someone who has not seen their art before. 

That's very important to us. To promote artists and give back to artists. Getting them involved in the process as much as possible, having fun, making new friends— we're looking forward to it. 

I've had the pleasure of talking to tons of amazing artists. I'm excited about seeing this project go forward and everyone working together.

## Community Questions ❓ [[13:25]](https://youtu.be/H4Fjo08ReJM?t=805)
(Discord channel: #project-management-calls)

**Mark:** We can wrap this call up with community questions. I saw that we had some questions. We'll start with Steve.

**Question**

> Bumping my question from before: Are future NFT drops from the team going to be prioritized to holders of XYZ tokens or Polymorphs? 
> ie; An exclusive grace period to buy ahead of the general public.

From: Steve XYZ

**Mark:** That's a good question, Steve.

**Tyler:** The question is whether Polymorph holders have premium access to buy?

**Al:** It sounds like pre-sale. 

**Mark:** Yes, whether we give Polymorph or XYZ holders exclusive abilities or a grace period. 

**Al:** That's not something we have decided.

**Tyler:** Yeah, I'd say that's TBD. (to be determined)

There are too many factors that can affect it. A lot of the NFT stuff we'll be launching early on will be burn-to-mint, the Polygon bridge etc.

I think we can work on those types of features in the future to provide more utility for XYZ holders. But, how that works or how we approach it— we are not ready to commit to anything around that.

Generally, there is a lot in the pipeline. That's a cool idea. But, we are likely many months away from considering something like that. 

**Mark:** One thing I'd touch on. We have other drops in the pipeline. But, over the last few months, we've prioritized polymorphs.

**Tyler:** We want Polymorphs to be great. We don't want a reputation where we start other drops without following through with our other stuff. We just launched Polymorphs. Now we're building games, rarity charts, burn-to-mints and other abstracts. 

A better answer to that question— we are not focused on timelines for new NFT drops until we see through the platform launch, auctions/minting, the marketplace and the additional work for the Polymorphs.

**Mark:** I guess the best answer is, you won't get our next NFT drop without having a Polymorph because you need to burn your Polymorph to receive the derivative. Our next drops are Polymorph derivatives. 

So, that drop will be exclusively for Polymorph holders. 

**Tyler:** Yeah, you'll need a Polymorph. 

**Mark:** You won't have the ability to buy these NFTs.

**Tyler:** They won't all be like that.

**Mark:** I'm just clarifying that the ones we are coming out with cannot be purchased.

**Tyler:** In the immediate future— let's say the next three months. We're focused on Polymorphs and building a team for them.

**Mark:** And getting the auctions/minting and the marketplace launched. We want to release our tools. We have stuff that we've been working on for the last six months. It's ready to go— at least it's very close.

There is still a fair amount of work to be done for the Polymorphs. We're not rushing anything, and we're not going anywhere. Our focus is on this right now and paying attention to what's at hand. 

That was a great question, Steve!


**Tyler:** Yeah, there is like an endless amount to build. The hardest thing to do is focus and push the immediate stuff— without having too much future creep.

**Mark:** I'm going to start saying this at the end of the calls. 

There have been 18 claimers of the airdrop!

We are at 18 now!

**Al:** Are there any more questions from that channel?

**Mark:** There are some, but they got answered through conversations and in the call itself. The only unanswered question, Steve re-bumped, then it got an answer.

**Dragos:** We'll add it to the front end of the DAO. You'll see how many weeks remain before you can claim the entire airdrop. That should get released very soon. 

**Mark:** That was something the community asked about in the project management channel. 

To clarify what Dragos said— we'll be adding a counter to the interface in the yield farming section. It will display the number of weeks the airdrop is at and how many weeks are in total. (ex; 3/100 weeks)

It will show you how many weeks you've been waiting!

Dragos said that's live in the next few days. 

I think that's everything, thank you, everyone! Tune in next time— in two weeks.

**Everyone:** Bye! 👋👋👋👋👋👋

**Al:** I'm literally shaking.

**Mark:** Shoutout to the [Flufs!](https://fluf.world/) And [Aaron!](https://twitter.com/aaronmcdnz) Thanks to all the universe supporters who went into that channel and supported our partners!

We appreciated everyone supporting the Flufs. We love our community. Thank you! We did not expect that from you guys— to jump to that so quickly.

We heard your feedback we believed that we marketed it enough. However, others expressed feelings that they wished it was more clear that it's affiliated with Universe.

**Tyler:** We were all quite surprised by that. They were originally supposed to launch on Thursday. Then that Saturday, it was delayed again. So, I signed off from that after that point. (I didn't get any either if that makes others feel better)

It could have been planned a bit better on both sides. But, I don't think there were any problems— it was a successful drop. These things are a cluster f**k, and they always are.

**Mark:** We'll try and give a better heads up next time. I think that was the main feedback from the community. 

**Tyler:** We'll do that! Next time we all skip leg day, we'll tell everyone else as well.

Get some faster internet! Move from Australia to the US. 😂

**Everyone:** ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
