## Intro
**Mark:** I think we have everyone from the team here now to go ahead and start.

**Tyler:** I'm picking up food right now. I've been on back-to-back calls today. I'm going to listen in. I will chime in maybe 5 minutes. I won't talk much in the beginning.

**Mark:** We will go ahead and we will do the project call part.

**Tyler:** Why don't you just get started and tell everybody what's going on in ETH Denver? That's what everybody wants to know about to start.

**Mark:** We were talking about that a little bit, but we can start.

## ETH Denver [[00:39]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=39) ‚úàÔ∏è üíª

**Mark:** We will be in ETH Denver tomorrow at the Hydra Event, and our founder, Tim Kang, will be DJing, which is a special treat. 

That is not the best part. We're going to be on multiple panels, and we will be speaking about the future of NFT platforms and the intersection of DeFi and NFTs. There will be multiple panels that we will be speaking at. The first one will be with Tim, Ryan and I. Then also with the CPO [Alexander](https://twitter.com/insider0x) from Rarible. We're super excited to meet and learn from him and be on a panel with him. It's awesome for us to be on that. I'm super excited to meet him finally. That's why we talked about Rarible when everyone hopped on this call. We were already diving into some of these chats. Then I'll be on another panel with Ben Lakoff from Charge Particles and Nick Emmons from Upshot HQ. We will be talking about DeFi and NFT. The videos will be recorded, and we will be able to share those with everybody if you're in ETH Denver right now. That's the Hydra Event.

I believe there are still spots available for general admission, but it will be a pretty sick event. It will be at this airport hangar, and the sound system will be crazy. We have [Angel Baby](https://twitter.com/angelbaby) performing. Illestrater (Tim Kang) will be DJing and a lot of other performances. Those are the ones that we're excited about. We are going to have much fun. It's from 02:00 P.M. Tomorrow, Denver time to 02:00 A.M., it will be pretty sick. Mango and Ben Lakoff have been helping us, and they've done an awesome job putting this event together. The sound systems are going to be crazy. Mango said if you're going to, bring your dancing shoes because we will be partying. 

That's the main event for Universe tomorrow. We sponsored the event, and we are a sponsor of ETH Denver, which was cool that we were able to do that. So we're excited about all of this. I'm already out here, and I'll be out there tomorrow. So if you want to meet me or go to an event, I'll have a bunch of the Universe gang with me, and we can coordinate and figure something out.

But we'll be until, I think, the 20th or the 19th. So if anyone is interested or wants to meet us finally, please reach out. Don't be shy. We will reach back out to you guys. Yes, the Hydra Event is where we're going Thursday, tomorrow, 02:00 P.M. To 02:00 A.M.

We can go ahead and just jump into the agenda. I wish Ryan were here because we have had much development and have had a lot of awesome goals in the past few weeks on the Dev Team.

**Tyler:** Mark, if you want, I can go through development when I leave the restaurant. I will discuss that when I'm back up the mountain in my car.

**Mark:** Okay. Perfect, man. üëå

## Propsals [[04:27]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=267) üó≥

**Mark:** I'll just go back into some of the coming proposals. Just because we talked about this on the last Project Call, I want to revisit it. Ryan last week brought up an OS Migration Tool and talked a bit about some things that we're looking into for XYZ incentives. People have been looking at LooksRare, and how do we do this? Or, How do we incentivize listings? Or, How do we do this? 

We have a few ideas we will propose through the forum and the DAO. Then Ryan will also put in a proposal to freeze the Polymorph base character's skin. We think that that may add some rarity and add a little more game ability to the Polymorphs. As the Clown Charles has become very sought out. I think some people in the community want to try and protect that.

**Tyler:** The truth is we're just not turning the base character scrambling back on. Clown Charles is the most, not by a long shot, but they're Clown Charles is the most rare polymorph. I don't think that's why doing the best or the most sought after. But he is the most rare.

**Mark:** Sorry, I'm trying to mute some people quickly.

Clown Charles is the most rare as of right now. Clown Charles has gotten quite the popularity. I'm more of a Mariguana guy myself, but I love Clown Charles. Clown Charles made a pretty sick appearance at the Super Bowl. I don't know if anyone saw that. Clown Charles had a pretty sweet seat and watched Aaron Donald win the Super Bowl.

### Shoutout: [Aaron McDonald](https://twitter.com/aaronmcdnz). [[06:52]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=412) üì£

**Mark:** Aaron McDonald. The FLUF got FLUF King. Also, that was an amazing time. A lot of the Universe team got to meet Aaron. Shout out to Aaron McDonald. He's one of the coolest human beings in the world. If you ever get the pleasure to meet him, don't be afraid to just say Hi to him. He is one of the nicest people in the world. I was leaving a party with Aaron, and some people that never even met Aaron asked if they could take a picture with Aaron. I don't know if they thought he was a Pro Football Player or something because he's a giant person. I've just never seen someone have so many random people love him. These people were, oh, I got to take a picture with this guy. Then all ten of these people took a picture with Aaron. I have the picture for proof. 

I'll tweet it later because it was proof of why Aaron is such an awesome guy. You cannot meet this guy and not like him. He is so awesome.

**Mark:** So shout out to Aaron. It was awesome meeting you. Also, meeting some of the other people who have been involved with League DAO and Universe was much fun meeting everyone out in Los Angeles. Hopefully, we meet even more people out here in ETH Denver this week. Tyler, are you anywhere close.

**Tyler:** Yeah. I came back from my car. Do we know if Troy is on this call?

**Mark:** Yeah, he is.

**Tyler:** Okay, cool, because Troy is in San Juan. 


## PR Update‚Äî NFT Awareness [[08:32]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=512) üáµüá∑ üéô

**Tyler:** Another general update of us putting on for spreading the awareness of NFTs everywhere. Troy and I live in Puerto Rico, and I wasn't able to make it today because I've been on many calls. I've been up since 03:00 A.M. because of some of the Development Updates. So Troy went and spoke at a panel today in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a lower income than most United States; it's not a State itself. They don't get a lot of the same subsidies. It's not a third-world country or anything, but it's not like Connecticut. 

Many people want to learn about opportunities and things they can do with Web3. A lot of them don't even know what Crypto is. Troy is not only a leader of Universe but the whole industry as a co-founder on a lot of projects, seed investors and prominent projects. He has been in the space for a long time. He took the time out of his day to talk on a panel with many people in Puerto Rico üáµüá∑ to teach them about what's going on in our industry and why it's exciting because the industry has many haters, and I think people get mixed messages.

So learning from one of the industry's greats is a huge blessing for people who don't get to go hang out at Harvard Business School. That's just a quick update. 

## Development Updates [[10:20]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=620) üèó üë∑

I've been up till 03:00 A.M. I guess I'll drop a bit of Alpha in terms of the Universe Launch timeline. We've been waiting on a scraper, which scrapes all the NFTs in the ecosystem and a generalized back-end that we had to build. I don't know how to explain that this back-end can be super simple or extremely complex. Suffice to say, a back-end that runs Amazon. They built a whole company from running the cloud infrastructure that originally powered their back-end down. Some companies can have a back-end that runs on a single server in their office, where Amazon started. So unlike front-end interfaces or even Smart Contracts that run on their own. When OpenSea is going down all the time.

A big reason for that. I've said this on numerous AMAs now; it's a big part of why we're delayed. A lot of the projects currently are using OpenSeas back-end. The reason that something like Looks Rare hasn't gone down is that a lot of the trading that's happening on that platform is not humans clicking buttons. I don't care if someone flames me, but it's wash trading. It's the same thing that UniSwap isn't wash trading, but Uniswap doesn't necessarily have humans clicking buttons on their website generating many of those transactions. A lot of them are market-making bots. They are financial. If you know a lot about finance, they're the equivalent of prop shops. They are algorithms that are running trades on that system. People in the NFT industry don't always understand that many things with the tokens are run by DeFi. I would not think that Looks Rare, if many of those are Algorithmic Bots running on those systems, necessarily need to be like humans clicking buttons. In the US, on the other hand, OpenSea needs a real back-end.

When you see all of the trading happening on OpenSea, yes, some of its probably Algorithmic Bots that are arbing one system to another. You get a cheaper price on LooksRare, and they go and sell it floor price on OpenSea. Or if Nifty Gateway has a 5 ETH difference on FLUF burrows than what OpenSea has, that's an arbitrage opportunity. 

I'm not saying that all of OpenSea's volume is humans clicking buttons. Still, in the history of Crypto, other than centralized exchanges like Coinbase and things like that, OpenSea has the most organic, real human being eyeballs on that site. So naturally, that growth from $10 million to $10 billion of volume has created a logistical nightmare for their team. I don't envy them for that. I don't have a ton of respect for some of these copy-paste projects that are coming out; I know that there are real good technologists building at places like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and building at places like [Zora](https://zora.co/). I have respect for [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/). So when you're making a product that real people want to use organically, you have to prepare that it's going to put a load on your system, and you essentially need to make sure that your system can handle the load.

Think about something like DraftKings. 99% of their traffic ultimately comes an hour before 01:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time in the United States. So you have to architect your entire system 17 weeks out of the year; you have to architect the entire system to uphold that load. The reason that Universe took so long was that we've been building a back-end. I've talked about this on past AMAs, not to repeat myself; I'm going to explain how we come out on the other side of this. We have been dodgy on when exactly we launch. Even on the last week's AMA, Marks said 6 weeks away.

**Mark:** I said 5 weeks but yeah.

**Tyler:** So, 5 weeks away, so now it would be 4 weeks. We didn't know the outcome of what was going to be in that scraper because we worked with a group externally to help us build that function once we got the back-end done. The reason is that many Web3 Developers don't have the experience of knowing how to build these massive back-end systems. We've never been as an industry load tested the way the OpenSea has.

Yes, they work at Coinbase, but they're not degening and launching Smart Contracts. So the dev ops and the back-end infrastructure of this industry, as we start to see mainstream adoption. OpenSea isn't going to be the only one that's going down all the time. The issue is that OpenSea is a centralized company, so all of their code is proprietary, and you don't need to. Even if it was an open-source company, that doesn't mean they need to open source the back-end infrastructure because anybody can run any back-end infrastructure to that code. So we knew that.

**Mark:** Essentially we knew OpenSea has that feature. They do give people access to their back-end through an API. If you use it, they cut it off. That's what they did to many projects, but that's this centralized control that we're seeking out to change that and fix it. But yeah, sorry to interrupt. 

**Tyler:** No, that's fine. 

We probably may throttle people if they try to DDoS our Network. But, not as bad‚Äî compared what OpenSea is doing ‚ÄîI don't blame them either, they're not just going to open-source their code. The other issue is that OpenSea, unfortunately, because they grew so fast, had to build in public; we got to fix many of these issues in private. So I think our infrastructure is much better architected and able to scale. However, we needed to be able to test this thing and make sure that it works properly. 


### Marketplace Launch [[17:15]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=1035) üñº üöÄ

So the timelines for launch have most likely been expedited, where there's one final component that we need to find a timeline on. So the way we're going to launch pretty much in the past 24 hours, now that we have this, we know it's working. We know it's scraping. That's why we were posting that on Twitter. That's an internal victory that has taken us 7 months to build, and it was an absolute bitch. I would be lying if I told you that I probably didn't know what I was signing up for when I launched Pepe's and then turned it into Universe; I didn't know it would be this hard.

It was my naivety. But we know how to do it now, so this thing's done. It's complete. ü¶æ

Now what we have to do is, we have to rig up all of the API endpoints and make sure that all the SDKs work properly. Then we need to figure out what features are in a V1 and a V2. Let's call it a semantics thing. I don't think anyone can expect when we launch a V1 that the V2 will take as long as the V1. By that, we've been doing internal Sprints that we haven't had a reason to show everyone how fast we're rapidly iterating on improving these products without a live front-facing product. So when I say like V1 versus V2, it may be just a 2 week sprint. It may be a 2 week sprint before a V1 feature becomes a V2 feature. In past AMAs, when we talked about the Auctions that would probably launch before the marketplace, we deprioritized the auctions even though the code is 99% done. We did that because we really can't launch the auctions until we have the marketplace. 

The reason the marketplace was delayed was the back-end and scraper. The back-end we have done a month ago. The scraper has been very difficult to build and finish. It's done, and it works better than the OpenSea scraper. It works better than any scraper I've ever seen in Ethereum, even Coinbases Scraper. That scraping transactions or history. I'm very pumped. This has honestly been one of the best professional days of my life. It's like Anakin Skywalker; when he finally gets that podracer working, he's doing what he's doing. But right now, we need to figure out; whether competitors are coming into the Market. We know that we have a better product, a substantially better product. So some the letting good be the enemy of great. I think that we can start pushing those into Sprints. So what we did today, now that we know that this thing works properly, we decided to sit down and say, what can we do? Or what do we need to do to remove this? To get it launched in a 2 week period? Worst case scenario, it turns to a 3 week period.

One of the things on the table that we internally decided absolutely can't be on the table is a Search Function because we just got the scraper. The Search Function has to be lined up to that scraper. Meaning if you line up the collections, how it scrapes those collections affects the search function in and of itself. We haven't been able to build the Search Function until we got that scraper and could verify that it worked properly. We'll be able to get this Search Function done in a 2 week period. That will ultimately determine whether or not this launches in 2 or 3 weeks. Everything else on our roadmap in this sprint is very, very, very doable. But ultimately, we can't launch a marketplace if you can't search for collections. So that brings us to the next thing. We launched the marketplace, and we know the scrapers extremely fast. Maybe we only allow users out of the gate so we can get it in that 2 week period to search for collections. However, we know that that scraper is extremely efficient, so all we need to do is rig up the endpoints and make it work properly to do all the things that annoy me about the OpenSea Scraper.

I can search my DNS, right, or my ENS. I can't search my wallet. If I have FLUFs Cobain or something, I can't go. Just look it up by FLUFs Cobain. I got to look for FLUFs and then figure out which one's called FLUFs Cobain. There's a massive opportunity in marketplaces that are being avoided, organized by those scrapers and the Search Function. The reason that the Search Function isn't being opened and the OpenSea Search Function isn't amazing is a result of their back-end. The way that it's architected where they're already getting massively load tested. So if you can run algorithms into that Search Function and run queries against it the way people do with Google's API, you end up resulting in many API calls that ultimately crash the server, right? We architected it so that it would not happen. However, I don't want a feature like that to delay the process. So as of 12 hours ago, we did not have the finished scraper. The finished scraper is done. It's been scraping. It's scraping faster than any scraper that we've ever seen.

And it's not substantially. So when you scroll down on OpenSea, and you can't see things, and you can't keep scrolling quickly, that's going to be a very different experience on our platform. I want everyone to understand that we're essentially releasing what I would call a beta when we release this. But behind the beta is us working to bring out all the alpha features that we've already coded. But those alpha features need to be rigged up to that API. And so we'll probably iteratively every 2 weeks, roll out a better and better experience. Then we'll roll out the auctions, and then we'll roll out all the Minting Contracts. In that time period, we may find bugs. We'll have to fix things. So I will say that I think that people immediately know how awesome it is, what we built, and how much of a better experience it is. But from a Dev perspective and a coding perspective, you won't know until you watch how fast we iteratively do things. Going forward, it's not going to be a 7 month wait for changes. It's going to be a 2 week wait that you're like, Holy shit, this got better.

We're going to add all the stuff that we built slowly. I don't want everyone to wait another 3 months when we know that if we drop what we have right now, it's better than existing competitors. So we want people to be able to use this product. But we will have our hands full, continuing to integrate everything. So I pray to God that it's 2 weeks. But if it's 3 weeks, it's here. This was a long journey, but we built it. When we release it, it will be an iteratively better experience. I don't know, every 14 days. That's why I'm saying that today is one of the best days of my professional career. I'm on cloud nine. I never see any bottlenecks at this point. We've dealt with every single one. The only bottleneck is the search function. And that search function isn't going to take a month to build.

**Mark:** I don't think it's going to be a problem. At a minimum, guys the minimum, you're not going to be able to search for a specific NFT, but you're going to have collection searches. You'll be able to find artists. So, creators and users.

**Tyler:** Right now, you just need to be able to search the collection because you're going to be able to click on the various ones. I don't want to commit to what is actually in the search at launch because we may only get the collections done. Then our only priority for the next 2 weeks is to rig everything else up. But one thing prioritizes another. So if we launch it and there's a bug, we have to fix that. So we need to launch it where you can search collections. That's at a minimum; we want to launch it with more. I do not think that launching it with more features than collections is worth delaying for a week. And that was the conversation that we had today. So realistically, there's no reason to delay the thing. When we launch it, it's not going to come out of the gate hitting OpenSea numbers. We've got time to add these other features, and there are zero reasons to delay. As long as you can search collections, you can find what you need to see. And then we'll integrate everything else that we've already coded. The back-end is coded.

The front end is coded. We now need to make the back-end scraper meet the back-end. We need to make the back-end scraper meet the front-end. And then everything that's supposed to be there to make it a superior experience will be there. But there's no reason we should delay this. We shouldn't let good be the enemy of the great. We should get everybody to use it. 

**Mark:** Everything is done. We're just connecting it all, and we're going to try and get this out ASAP. The main thing that everyone needs to know as part of our process of getting this out is that we are going to delay the auctions and prioritize the marketplace. We think that most community cares more about the marketplace and getting a marketplace out. It's what we've promised at the auction.

**Tyler:** That was my call where I just told everyone that I did not. I think many auctions before the Marketplace, and I'll explain why many people wait for the auctions, even me. 

I want to do custom auctions if we do custom auctions without having a marketplace when FLUFs launched because Universe wasn't, auctions weren't live yet. Well, if all the initial listings when you do an auction, this is why we mark the auction to zero. This is how we get all the long tail ability to get onto the marketplace. So if you're on an auction platform, let's say it's a website, and you essentially, while you're minting, you're sniping off of the floor, you're listing things on the floor. You're listing the items above. You're going in there; you're seeing what everything is. That's where 90% of the initial listings happen, and everything migrates to the initial listings. If we launch auctions before marketplace, every single action on our platform is sending traffic that sticky traffic and listings to competitive marketplaces. The auctions are in and of itself a gift to artists.

It's also a long tail marketing strategy for us where we're going to bring in superior artists because they're going to get more of their art. The people that buy those off mint are going to list them somewhere, and they're going to list them exactly where if it's a button that you can list directly off of the auction, they're going to list it on Universe. If you can't do that, they're going to list it on OpenSea. 

So if we go and do a bunch of really dope auctions, let's say that Non-Fungible Pepe launches on our Auction Marketplace before OpenSea happens, or what happened with FLUFs? They launched before our marketplace existed. All of that traffic now went to OpenSea, so we should not be launching auctions until marketplace is done. That's just a business decision that has nothing to do with code. I think it's a very dumb decision to do that. So the auctions could be done this week. We shouldn't launch them until the marketplace is humming. I don't see any reason to do that.

**Nick:** Makes sense to me. 

**Mark:** Yeah, I agree.

So that was a Development Update from Tyler.

**Tyler:** That's why I don't give Development Updates, I'm probably going to get yelled at by the Devs, but it is what it is. 

**Mark:** Ryan usually does that part, but he's on a plane to ETH Denver, speaking tomorrow. Thank you. Tyler. 

Now I'll give some updates on the polymorph because we've been a little quiet about them. ü§ê

## Polymorphs [[30:59]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=1859) ü§°

**Mark:** There's something that we have been building in secret. I'm not sure if many people have known, but many people came out and said they didn't like how the Polymorphs looked‚Äî they said they were ugly at the beginning of their journey, which hurt my feelings. 

But it's okay. I got over it. It strengthened my confidence. What we did was we reached out to many artists in the space. We chose to go with some artists that have some smaller platforms just so that we could help promote their art and their collections. But we had a few artists come in and help us build a cool drop called the Polymorphic Faces. We're going to use the Polymorphic Contracts to allow people to come in and mint these artworks, and they'll be able to be scrambled, but they're going to be more of a PFP. It's a mix of the new and old because we'll have those original Polymorph faces. üé≠

**Mark:** But there is a lot of really cool art that has been submitted for this project. Some of our internal artists were a part of it and also went out and got a ton of this out in the industry because we wanted to promote some of them. 

### Shout out to [Kyle Gordon](https://twitter.com/kylegordonart) üì£ 

He helped me meet and connect me with many artists that have not as big a platform, but we didn't want to get [Fvckrender](https://twitter.com/fvckrender) or the biggest people for this because Universe has always said that we want to be a platform for artists. How are we helping if we get Fvckrender or some of the biggest artists and get them to do a project? So we wanted to promote some of these other artists that just wanted. We thought that we wanted to give them exposure. Not necessarily that they needed it, but it just helps. We wanted to create an artist-driven project around the Polymorphs, and we haven't figured out exactly how we're going to distribute them. We're leaning more towards a timed mint where everyone who has a Polymorph will have the ability to go and mint for a certain time frame.

**Algy:** We have a lot of really cool tools coming for our marketplace and minting. So we will maybe use one of those to roll out these Polymorphic faces.

**Mark:** Yeah, it is a blessing being an NFT Marketplace that has any NFT collection because we can put a burn-to-mint button on the front-end of our marketplace. 

That is the cool part. We talked with Mancel a few weeks ago. He's already asked us if there's a way that we can use the Ash token & add front-end features to his art drop. Realistically, we haven't been able to fully commit and help him yet because our dev team and talent are focused on getting this marketplace out. But we can do a lot of really cool things with our front-end over the long term. And it's not just.

**Tyler:** Wait. Let's clarify one thing. 

> **I don't want the community to think we took dev funds and used those Polymorphs to build the marketplace.** 

It wasn't a fundraising effort for Polymorphs. We never moved a dime of the ETH. Okay.

That's very important for everyone to know. That we never touched that capital. What ended up happening is that we still are hiring a full-time team to work on the Polymorphs. That's what I want, a dev team to be able to build cool stuff. Not for any other reason, other than I love the Polymorphs. I want to build cool things into them. So I'll self-fund it if I need to. 

But every single good developer that we found ended up getting sucked into the marketplace. That wasn't intentional. It wasn't taking resources away. When we found someone, they filled another role we needed for the marketplace. The scope of the marketplace, auctions and minting, and what we were building grew exponentially‚Äî 1000X ‚Äîwhile we were building it. So everything that we've done on the marketplace side has been funded by the Multi-Sig that the original contributors provided. And none of the Polymorph money has been crossed over. 

> We've never asked for any of it. We haven't touched it.

**Mark:** We will touch the polymorph money with our first proposal because we will pay some of the artists involved in these Polymorphic Faces. We didn't want them not to get paid if the community wanted. I don't think it was a significant amount of money.

**Tyler:** It's a community's decision. If they don't want to pay them, you're making us look like assholes. But they're artists. They did hard work.

**Mark:** Yeah, I will put in a proposal to set that up over the next week.

**Tyler:** I have some alpha that I want to drop on Polymorphs before we make that proposal, just so everyone's aware. Mark, get through what you're saying.

**Mark:** I was just clarifying that we want to use that money for Polymorph things. It's not for us. We want to build. We want to build other cool collections. The whole reason we did this Polymorphic Face is that, honestly, I love the Polymorph. I never thought art was a problem. Some people didn't like it. We heard that feedback, and we said, okay, let's get some sick artists from the community and the NFT space and build a cool, aesthetically pleasing art project.

**Tyler:** I think the Polymorphs looks sick, but I always saw them as little video game creatures. I don't think Mario is the Mona Lisa either. So if you play a video game and every NPC looks like the Mona Lisa‚Äî I mean, cool. But, I'm more worried about the gaming dynamics at that point, so we built tech into them.

**Mark:** I like the [CryptoDickButts](https://twitter.com/CryptoDickbutts) üçÜ. Some people think those things are ugly. 

**Tyler:** I think they're beautiful regardless of whether they're ugly. Our goal is to give them utility and make them functional. If you want to make the Mona Lisa functional, she's Creative Commons. Da Vinci's been dead for 500 years. I didn't start doing this for art critics. I think NFTs have a lot more use cases than art, and it's going to require tech in order to get them there. 

I'll just say I wouldn't play a video game where everybody looked like the Mona Lisa or hang out in the Metaverse that everybody did.

**Mark:** Yeah, I mean, to each their own. I'm probably on Tyler's side too. When I play Skyrim, I think I usually use the Arc. It's like the Ugliest character in the game. Okay, let's jump off of some of this development stuff. We talked about Polymorphs.

### Tyler Talk; Metaversia‚Äî Details Redacted [[39:49]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=2389) üë®‚Äçüè´ ‚ò¢Ô∏è

**Tyler:** Oh, wait, hold on. I want to say one thing about the Polymorphs‚Äî I want to clarify everything around the Polymorph funds. (When we pull out proposals)

Mark and many of the team members on this call don't know this. Everybody knows that I'm somewhat attached to Goblin World or Goblin Town from FLUF World. I gave that project to FLUF World, because I thought it was becoming too much of an overlap. 

I was self-funding a project that I thought got too close. So I gave it to them. I decided to do it afterward with the artists working on it‚Äî I self-funded my own NFT drop. That's ultimately a gift to the DAO. At least it started that way. Hopefully, the DAO will give me some reimbursement from it because it's been more expensive than I expected. But I hired a Grammy-Nominated musician to make game art and sound. I'm not going to drop what they are. These are all variations of the Polymorphs, and they'll probably Mint when people buy them as a true profile picture rarity type cascade.

> However, they are not going to be profile pictures. (PfPs) 

I've already hired 3D artists. They're building maps. They're building many things, which is why it got a lot more expensive than I thought. But whatever. I'm here to have fun. I'm going to make no money off this. I'm giving it to the DAO. The DAO is, if it does well. 

I will say this part. I'm not going to say what they are called, but I will say that the land in the created world is called Metaversia. So the domain was available. And I thought it was dope. I will want to vote it through the DAO so that I can properly build the stuff. This stuff isn't cheap, right? 

I can make 3D renderings, but building something will not be inexpensive. The point of this was that I wanted a Metaverse that I could run around with the Lobby Lobsters. We'll have their area and lair. I want what X is redacted that I want to drop. And also, the Polymorphs themselves that we've been 3D rendering so that you can play around in the FLUF burrows.

And then I think FLUFs like us‚Äî I think we should let the FLUFs and Party Bear in as well. But I don't want to be a place where people can listen to music. I wanted to make it very different, fun, and another use case. 

So long story short, I don't know the timeline in which I'm going to drop it because we're pretty busy with the marketplace, and even team members don't know that. I've been self-funding this because I didn't want to distract them and get them involved. But the artists that we have involved are incredible. The original concept that we drop is just the face. What's coming behind it is what's important. 

I want to have Metaversia. I want the Polymorphs to be able to run around and mess stuff up and have fun. The whole point of them is that they were supposed to be fun. So everything from the music, the art, everything, I would say that my intention is not to release an artistic masterpiece. I intend to make functional technology that is very fun to use. So I'm going in a different direction than the rest of the industry. üèÉ

When that happens, Multiverse, a company that Troy started to build some things on top of Universe‚Äî I understand the concept of DAOs, and I hate companies, too ‚ÄîThe reason that a company needs to exist is not my and Troy's decision. In many cases, there isn't a legal precedent for us to be able to do certain things, like sign licensing agreements. 

### TECHNICAL TROUBLES

**Mark:** Tyler, I think we lost you. Maybe you stopped talking. Can anybody hear me?

**Tyler:** Can everybody hear me?

**Mark:** No, we lost you for a second, man. Okay. The last thing we heard was

**Tyler:** I rolled up to my house. I hooked up with my WiFi. I'm almost done off my high horse. 

**Mark:** No, you're good. The last thing we heard was about licensing agreements.

**Tyler:** Right, so, there are certain scenarios where we may need to license a song, or we may need to license a technology to run nodes. 

You can't do everything in a DAO right now, and it's because nobody went DAO first before me, and Troy did it at Barnbridge. There are no legal frameworks to do all this stuff yet. So there are some things that we need to have a company do. Many of these Artists will probably be put under Troy's company in this scenario, and we had to change the name again because of legal reasons. Multiverse was trademarked. We're doing everything Creative Commons and open source. So we had to change the name to Graviton. üß≤

While all of this happens, we have been modelling those Polymorphs. They're all 3D. All the specs and renders will be the same. I will ask that the DAO votes me money so that I can build this thing. 

But ultimately, you can honestly tell me to get lost. Hopefully, you pay me the money that I at least put in because I thought it would be way cheaper. üòÖ

> At the end of the day, I don't want to make a profit on this. 

I just want to build some stuff that I want to use. So I'll drop it. Everything will be coded to the DAO. I'll probably put something on the front end that pulls out at least some money for the artist to help me. And then it's up to everybody here to let me build this. That's what I want to do. We're not taking the polymorph money to do anything with it. If anything, I'm spending my own money to make them cool. I do want to build this. And it's been fun as shit. It's honestly been a blissful distraction from real work.

### End of TT; Metaversia‚Äî Details Redacted üë®‚Äçüè´ ‚ò¢Ô∏è

**Mark:** You wouldn't know something really funny is to back up what Tyler is saying. We have internal Polymorph calls with our artists. We have many developers, but we also probably have an in-house team of probably between all of the DAOs that Tyler is involved in. We may have 30 to 35, but Universe has 15 to 20 artists working on many different things. 

### Polymorph Leak [[47:35]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=2855) ü§° ü§´

Over the last few weeks, we've been working on the high-quality Polymorphs. Some of these Polymorphs you may have seen on Twitter are realistic, but they're not quite fully 3D. We've had three-hour internal calls with which all the artists have been having so much fun. We are going back over because one of our lead artists knows how to do some pretty cool development stuff. His name is Vjislav.

He built this generator. And honestly, Tyler thinks that we should release this to many different teams so that they can practice trying to figure out if art is clipping. We've seen a lot of NFT projects have bad clipping.

**Tyler:** Well, that one that Coinbase just started using. What are they called the Hapes? Hapes, you know how their ears clip off? We built internal software to render our things to make sure that that didn't happen. I think we should release it after the Polymorphs so people can play around with what they get if they scrambled. 

But even more so, I honestly think that we should give that to the industry so people can use it. We just built it for ourselves. I don't even know V did that. It's a beautiful interface/tool.

**Mark:** Some people reposted some of those online, and you might see that some of the assets are not lined up perfectly. Some people tweeted them. So I hope I don't get any bad feedback, but they're not dumb.

**Tyler:** They're not lined up because it's just testing software. That's what we're using to make sure they are. Right. 

**Mark:** Many of those images were blurry, and they were on a line. I promise you; these are all high resolution. We're on week 3 of just testing with that generator to make sure that we don't have clipping errors. Sorry if I sound like I'm out of breath. I'm like the way in a high altitude. So I'm just trying to get used to this.

**Algy:** I was trying to talk about this on the last AMA, but Trevor told me not to hold off. 

That generator is such a simple build. I don't see why we wouldn't open-source that and just let people know that they can fork it if they want. To use it for their project. As soon as I saw it, I was thinking, why is every project not doing this? 

It's so simple and a fun way to check the art, and make sure you have no clipping errors and no other errors in any of the art. I'm surprised that it's not already a thing that people have access to. If we can provide that, that's just super helpful. It's not even about the fun, though. There are even good projects. I'm not going to lie even on the FLUFs. There are a few FLUFs that have little glitches. They have certain trait pairs. 

I told Aaron he should do it for the Seekers‚Äî for every project. Every single project should be doing this.

**Mark:** Internally, it's just something we're using. 

But we are going to look at releasing that for everyone to use. So I think we've gone over enough stuff internally to go on because I want to be cognizant of time. 

I know that we have a few questions in the Pre AMA Channel. So if you're listening and this is your first AMA, we have a Pre AMA Channel. You guys can go on there. 

## Pre AMA Questions [[51:16]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=3076) ‚ùì

**Mark:** We're going to start with Fluffer Nutter. He had a pretty good question today about what we had a forum post a few weeks ago.

### **Question:**

What was the outcome of the thread we had on the governance site discussing giving away XYZ tokens as an airdrop to OpenSea users? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** He talks a bit about his opinion, Looks Rare and then talks about the new X2 Y2 marketplace and says he's not a fan of these airdrops because people are dumping them. We have not decided as a community if that's something we're going to do. We will have to push that to a DAO proposal, and we'll let the XYZ token voters vote on it.

I think incentivizing OpenSea users is very important because that's where most of the liquidity is. I do see the side of people who get airdrops dump them. We're not so worried about the token. We're more worried that this can decentralize XYZ further.

**Tyler:** The issue is it hasn't. 

I can answer this question. I think after SOS it seemed like a good idea. After Looks, it seemed like a good idea. Ultimately it's very similar to YFI or Yield Farming. This stuff works until it doesn't‚Äî ICOs work to decentralize tokens. But then there were reasons that we can't do them anymore. Then we had other ways that we tried to distribute these networks. Those may or may not work anymore. 

What happens when you distribute these things, and then people acquire them? It's hard to talk about this without price because the price isn't the outcome. The outcome needs to be getting this in the hands of many people. But after Looks, it stopped working because that marketplace that is good that it has X in it‚Äî it started doing it last night. Those were bots that just sold immediately. So it doesn't do anything to foster a community. If it becomes a race, how fast can you play hot potato and get rid of this thing? I don't even know when that question was posted. 

It may have been posted before last night, but I think that last night we can accept that. If we decide to give rewards to OpenSea users, that's been done 3 times by now, and we're just signing up to not put it in the hands of people that are going to help us govern the protocol. So why would we do it? It's not my decision, but I think it's a bad idea. We need to have a good product, and then we need to figure out how to incentivize people to use it. But this is YFI version 4 or 5. It didn't work after a while. 

**Fluffer Nutter:** Is it an open discussion? Can we. 

**Mark:** Yeah, for sure. 

Our last few AMAs have been like questions in the discord in our chat channels. We would love for people to come up and have discussions. Don't be afraid to talk. Like Tyler and I can talk all day, I know, but we love people coming up and talking. So yeah, Fluffer Nutter. Take it away, dude.

**Fluffer Nutter:** When we originally had that discussion, I don't know if it was the governance. I don't know what that place is called, but where we had that forum discussion. That was around when the SOS came out, and most of us in that thread agreed with it. It seemed like a good idea, but I agree with what Tyler has just said 100%. 

Although it would be cool if we could come up with something, I don't think the token airdrop is the move. 

I'm in many NFT communities, and I'm an NFT person, and at this point, I'm just ready to dump. They're all doing the same thing, it seems. But I think you're right where we need to incentivize people to join this platform. But there has to be a way to do it besides just airdropping people tokens. There has to be some better way because, in the end, much stuff came out about LooksRare last night also. And much stuff got doxxed on them, and what they're doing with the money and they're just selling all the wrapped ETH that they're wish washing in on themselves.

And now X2Y2. So at this point, by the time Universe drops, I feel like NFT users will be hesitant. People don't even want to connect their wallets to claim these things as NFT users because we're afraid of the scam. üò∞

I agree with you.

**Mark:** This might sound crazy, but this might be the thing that the NFT space needed. 

A lot of us were DeFi people, and we knew about the risks of Crypto. That's why it's so easy for these Bored Ape people. They just get over their seed phrase. They were never taught crypto security or don't keep their Crypto keys on a cloud server.

**Algy:** Fluffer Nutter makes a good point about how people are dumping 100%. When I get one of these drops, the first thing I think is to dump it immediately and buy into projects that I have a conviction for‚Äî I do. 

**Tyler:** We didn't spend all this time building this marketplace...

**Algy:** Let me finish, Let me Finish.

The big thing about it is that it hasn't been discussed in our strategy, and I don't know what we're talking about. So I won't explain that right now, but I think that the strategy that we've come up with has been thought out a ton and incentivizing people to move over their listings from OpenSea on the Universe. Anyone willing to do that in the top 200 projects is somebody in the NFT community who understands and is willing to try out a new platform. 

So I think you're right that just giving people tokens and saying here you go is not the move, but that's not what we want to do.

**Tyler:** I think we need to have a 2 week period. We have enough people in this discord that stuck around. Like over 1000 people will use Universe in the 1st 2 weeks. If we give nothing away‚Äî I think it will be more than 1000 ‚Äîwe need to get feedback from the true believers to start.

**Mark:** I also think that working like.

**Tyler:** Okay, hold on, Mark, let me finish. 

We could have done it 7 months ago if we wanted to drop a Ponzi Scheme. We could have built an interface and plugged into the OpenSea API and built a pump and dump token and left, and we'd all be rich. We are building this to be a long-term thing. And many people that want those airdrops are asking for them so that they can make an immediate return off of other people's expense. We want this thing to be in the Universe for a long time, and we want real users who want to govern the platform. We already have people that have stuck around and have been waiting for this and believed in it. 

Let's release it in 2 weeks. Let's figure it out. I don't think we should incentivize listings to move over even out of the gate. We need to make sure that those things don't break from our core community of true believers, even moving the listing through. We have that luxury because we did this the right way, knowing what we built. Let's launch it. Let's give it two weeks, and then I think we have a very long time to vampire attack OpenSea. üßõ

**Fluffer Nutter:** Yeah. ü§ù

I'll be done after this. I agree, though, 100%, that when you initially said that we need to incentivize the OpenSea users. 

But in retrospect, also, I don't think we need to incentivize the OpenSea users. I believe the OpenSea users are begging and seeking something new. I guess you're right. I don't think airdrop is the way to incentivize, at least not right away. But I agree that it needs to be done. And I think as a community, deciding a way to incentivize other people to come is the best way to go. And regardless of what is decided, I stand behind you guys no matter what. So I'm Universe till I die. I always have been, always will be. So thanks for letting me speak. üíô

**Mark:** I appreciate that, man. 

**Algy:** I want to point out something because I'm having a conversation with Gunner about it in this Pre AMA. 

This is one of the big things that we talked about at the beginning because the thing that sounds the best is airdrop to users who use our platform. But then it opens the door for so many exploitable situations. Let's say we do an airdrop for everyone who bids on auctions. People can just make a million while it's in bid. Let's say we make an airdrop for everyone who sells an item. People can just wash trade. Let's say we make an airdrop for, I'm not going to sit here and do this, but it goes on and on. You have to consider every exploit because people will do it. The same thing is happening with some of the others. We wanted to make this upvote system with our voting, but there are many exploitable situations. We are almost going to have to make it decentralized through another aspect by using maybe snapshot or something.

**Tyler:** Nobody's used this platform yet. Nobody's launched at this point without an airdrop. It's more innovative to launch without some type of airdrop. Why don't we get this out knowing that we have a real community, get them to use it, see where the faults are, and that's what we start to incentivize. 

For all we know, we launch this thing. People have been waiting for it, and listings move on over. I don't think that's a high likelihood, but there's a chance that it will happen. We know that people have been waiting for this thing. We know that people are trying to front-run us. We know that we have a better product. Let's get that product out. Let's let it sit in the market. Let's get feedback from our true close net people, and then let's figure out a strategy to go after OpenSea long term. Dumping all the tokens in the treasury just to give them to OpenSea users‚Äî It hasn't worked up to this point. So let's not reinvent the wheel.

**Algy:** We could use the Dr Opium thing in collaboration with this idea.

I like the strategy that we came up with. The top 200 projects make much sense because of this whole exploit situation that I brought up earlier. If you include projects with low volume, it creates the window for people to do a low-effort project, create volume, and then exploit our airdrop. So using the top 200 projects is almost necessary if we end up doing this route because it prevents so many exploits, 90% of them. 

The idea of making it to where it's not listings moving forward. Once our Marketplaces are out, only pre-existing listings on these top 200 projects will qualify for the airdrop if you migrate them. And that listing, honestly, in my opinion, should have to sell. Even that right there can be exploited because somebody could just buy it on their other wallet. But there's a limit at that point. It's only these NFTs and these top 200 projects. So there'd be a limit to how much could be taken from that.

It would get people's eyes on the project with the most volume and NFTs, the largest whales. Even if some people are dumping the token at the beginning, it would have people's NFTs all available to trade on Universe, and they're getting charged less fees moving forward. Why would they not keep using that platform if it costs less and the team is decentralized, and it's a DAO you can keep using if you want.

**Mark:** Essentially what Aly is trying to say is what everyone says; How do you build a valuable platform?

We are taking the approach of quality. It's that much better to use our marketplace than others.

**Tyler:** That's where we need to start because we know it's better in some areas. We don't know where people will complain and think it sucks. 

Right now, that's what I would urge the community and everyone to ask questions about. I'm not saying we don't go to market with the tokenomic strategy. In no way am I saying that. I think we have a superior product, and the people on this call, how many people are on this call, over 100 or over 50? These people will probably try the platform out, and they're going to give their feedback. We can get that feedback, intake it, and then figure out a strategy. When LooksRare came out, no one knew. What LooksRare was when this new project came out last night. It's been in the market for 2 weeks. No one was paying attention to it. So they resorted to that. But right now, I think we have the scenario to release this thing in 2 weeks, if not 3 weeks, and then we can intake feedback for a 2 week period and figure out a more formalized go-to-market.

We may have a vulnerability. There could be a hack in the system; there could be a hack in the incentive itself. We should push this thing out, get feedback from everyone, and they all conclude some ideas we have. We probably have good ideas because we've been using the thing, and we know how it works. I honestly want everyone else's idea. Once they've had a chance to toggle with it, I think everybody will have more information in 2 weeks to make a better decision on what we do with it. I don't believe that we have to launch with a LooksRare or X2Y2, whatever the thing it's called.

**Mark:** I'm telling you that anyone who will see our front-end will say that it is superior. We're not going to launch a marketplace that doesn't filter. It works. There's a reason why we took the time, and we didn't release it in October when we had thought we were going to be able to. We had to keep building. The industry changed. When we started building, OpenSea had what, 100,000 wallets? Now they have almost 1 million unique wallets. OpenSea didn't even know they were going to have that many users. Their site breaks every single day. Honestly, it's a blessing that we got to watch it, and we were able to build a back-end that was going to be able to scale with the industry at the time. 

Tyler said this before; I think Uniswap was getting 11-12,000 clicks a day. That was the number one visited DeFi site. They had the most traffic for it until OpenSea started doing a billion dollars in volume. Some of those months that OpenSea did crazy volume, so did Uniswap.

We looked at these things, and we know. üëÄ

**Tyler:** They were swapping into ETH. It's probably related. üòÜ 

Everyone, you're right.

**Mark:** It's related. Everyone's pulling their ETH off cold storage. They say we got to go swap and buy some NFTs. 

**Tyler:** They're swapping into ETH, selling ETH, and selling it into USDT or USDC to get it to exchange because they need to pay bills like an artist. Right? They're related. But ultimately, everybody, I think we can end this conversation and say that we should release the product without any type of grand glory or Ponzi-nomic bullcrap and let people start using it. Then we have time to operate. These flash in the pan things. They've never worked in history, even [Sushi](https://sushi.com) üç£. I don't think it's more successful than [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) ü¶Ñ, right?

**Mark:** It's not.

**Tyler:** The empire is strengthening.

**Mark:** But you're right, Tyler.

**Tyler:** I don't think it's on the route to be either, is my point. This is a good way to make the founders shit quick, and everybody else is left. That's not the plan here. We took all the time building a real product. I think we release a real product, get product feedback, and then work with this community that we built to figure out how we improve it over time. That's how you scale helpful something. That's how Uniswap did it. That's how Maker DAO did it. So we need to ignore these flash in pan Ponzis. If we wanted to create a flash in the pan Ponzi, why did I not just do it 8 months ago, change my face and disappear from the industry? 

There's no reason to burn our token supply. For what? To get awareness for something. I think we have a long time to do that. This is a long way to build a real product that works and gets real users. That's what OpenSea did. They started in 2018 or 17. They hired Nate - who was working for me in 2018, so I know he wasn't CTO then. [Maker DAO](https://makerdao.com/) took 5 years.

I'm not saying that I think it's going to take that long in an NFT market where everybody's excited, but we don't need to piss away our token supply on a maybe. We need to get people using it, and we need to come up with a plan as a community and launch it and know that we have something worth defending and stay community-driven.

**Mark:** Yeah, I agree with you, Tyler.

I think we can move away from this question. Thank you, Fluffer Nutter, for that question that honestly led to a pretty good discussion. üçª

### **Question: avgmayosandwich**

If an artist or a contributor has a collection they want to have on the marketplace exclusively, how would they go about getting that started? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** And he uses the example the OpenSea says that you need third-party requirements and cooperation to coordinate and settle this. 

> I can shortly answer this and say that Universe XYZ is more of a protocol marketplace. 

So realistically, I don't know if you can. Anyone can technically build a front-end to your listing if you list on Universe, so it'd be very hard to make it exclusive to Universe XYZ, like our front-end. When something's listed on Universe XYZ back-end, it's listed on the protocol level. We see Marketplaces vertically, and also we see L2 cross-chain stuff coming into play. 

What if you had a central membrane to put all the listings on? 

Anyone can build a front-end and access that liquidity. I think that's the best way to explain that. And if that makes sense, you can see why that would be hard to make. It is essentially exclusive. I'm not even sure I have the Smart Contracts expertise to say that you can even make an NFT exclusively listable on an individual marketplace. I'm not even sure if that's possible because I could make a contract that always works around some of this stuff. So that's a very hard question to answer. If you listed on Universe protocol, it's going to be listed across the whole ecosystem, and anybody that plugs into it will be able to access it.

I'm not sure exclusivity is possible on a protocol level, and I'm not sure it will help your NFT project, but that's my opinion. NBA TOPSHOT has done great, but I always am the arguer that I think NBA TOPSHOT would have done way better if they had, just more ways to access those NFTs than going through Zapper or what was. It? Dapper Labs? I got locked out of my NBA TOPSHOT account.

It took me 2 months to recover it, and then I never bought an NFT on that platform again because that was just my experience. But hopefully, I answered that. 

I'm going to keep scrolling down just to see more questions. It looks like many stuff people are commenting just on the conversations we've been having. Does anyone want to ask a question while I'm reading all the conversations? Please feel free. If I server muted you and you want to ask a question, tag one of the team and me, or I will unmute you. We just mute people who are making noise. If I server mute, it mutes for everyone while we're recording the call. 

Okay, Donbovan has a question here.

**Mark:** Okay, I'm not sure he was talking to us. My bad, guys, I just lost my spot. I just lost Don Bovin's question I was just about to read. 

### **Question: Donbovan65**

People are focused on the floor prices, and I think the floor on OS is the standard. How can Universe become the go-to site for people to determine the floor value of their NFT? 

### **Answer**

**Mark:** Okay, I can answer this question because this has a lot to do with liquidity competition. 

In the same way that DEXes and centralized exchanges work, there are arbitrage opportunities in finance. That's just how financial markets work. People do stuff called triangular arbitrage in finance, where they will let bots trade 3 different currencies to make a profit. There are always going to be different floor prices. I think OpenSea has that niche right now where people think that the floor price on OpenSea is the floor price in general. But even last week, we had an AMA, and Algy even brought up those relics that people were buying on OpenSea.

You can buy them cheaper on Nifty. While OpenSea, sometimes everyone's distracted by it. I can see the floor price on OpenSea, but there are other Marketplaces where you can get reasonable prices too. I think it's a personal opinion that people think that the floor price is on OpenSea because everyone's going there. But OpenSea is not. 

The floor price is the lowest listed NFT on the entire market, and it just depends on where you can get that and what place they are listed on price. It's no different than if I want to sell on this marketplace. I can sell my NFTs for nothing on OpenSea. But is that the floor price? It is at the moment.

The same as going to the store. If I'm going to go to the store and buy milk, I can go to Publix and maybe spend a little bit more on a gallon of milk, go to Walmart, or hell, I can get milk delivered to my house. It depends on the situation. That's just how it is‚Äî realistically. 

Trevor wants to come up. Maybe he doesn't want to come up and talk anymore.

**Trevor:** Can you hear me?

**Mark:** Yes, we can hear you now, man.

## Scraper [[1:20:34]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=4834) ‚õì

**Trevor:** Hey guys. I'm [Trevor](https://www.graviton.xyz/team), CTO over at Graviton üß≤. (Formerly known as Multiverse) 

I've been an engineer and architect for 20 years now. I've been with Barnbridge and Universe since the beginning. I might know some of you on Discord, but I'm not as active on there anymore since I'm usually in the weeds with all the development work I've been doing. So I'd like to discuss a couple of differences between our existing scraper as it is deployed today and some of the other scrapers in the industry and the improvements we've made.

Currently, the scraper that you see the results of when you go to the My NFT's page. That's currently depending on several APIs, namely OpenSea and [Moralis](https://moralis.io/). And there are many issues with that because you get into throttling rate limiting, and it's also not built in such a way that it's very scalable. We have vastly improved this. So the current scraper is built on microservice architecture. It's all running on Kubernetes in such a way that it's massively scalable. Anytime we'd like to add additional nodes, we spin up more replicas and have more power going through that scraper.

It also does not depend on any kind of external API whatsoever. We're only using pure blockchain data from a full Ethereum node, so we never get into the situation where we get rate limited. Those are a couple of the core differences, but overall it's extremely well architected. 

It's built-in such a way that it's modular, so we'll be able to use this for ERC 20s as well as 721s, 1155s and anything in between. We're also considering possibly making this a service for users to build their own projects, power analytics etc. 

They might be able to do that in the future. Another core difference here is that this thing is scraping the entire blockchain. It's not just looking at certain wallets or contracts; it's getting every NFT from the entire blockchain since NFTs were created, and even before that; it even supports Crypto Punks. It's essentially all-inclusive. That means you don't need to wait as soon as you go to Universe and connect your wallet. It's already going to have all of that data ready to go. I think this is pretty exciting. It's a huge victory for us. 

We're very proud of it, and I look forward to unleashing this to the public and letting you guys go crazy. üßô


**Mark:** Yeah, we're super excited about the scraper. Honestly, we probably could have released paper October, but if it wasn't because of our friends at FLUF World for making such badass entities playing music videos. We are being able to swap trades and do all this crazy stuff. But luckily, they were able to drop that technology to help us build an even better scraper. 

### Shoutout: [Fluf World](https://twitter.com/flufworld) Team and the New Zealand developers! üêá ü•ù

They have helped us with getting the FLUFs onto the scraper. We appreciate you guys, and shout out to Aaron's team, too, for helping with that.

**Trevor:** I'll share a little bit of statistics with you. The scraper has been running for 16 hours, it has already scraped 261,000 NFT tokens and 335,000 NFT transfers, and that's in under 24 hours. So it's highly optimized, it's extremely fast, it's extremely robust, and it's exceptional.

**Algy:** That is awesome. I know we've been working on that one, so that's exciting. üëè

**Mark:** All right, I'm just scrolling through some more questions. If anyone would like to come up and ask them to feel free.  

### **Question: Gunner**

Is there a limit token per time frame? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I'm not sure what you are referring to on that question. Maybe if you want to come up and maybe reframe that question, I'm not sure what you completely mean.


### **Question:DonBovan65**

If someone wants to buy a FLUF on secondary, how do we get them to come to the Universe site versus OpenSea when shopping for one to buy?


### **Answer**

**Algy:** This, exactly right here, is a great example of how the top 200 Project airdrop would incentivize people in a way people who have already paid that gas fee to list. I don't know if all of you know this because I know many people are listening who are giving opinions that don't trade NFTs. Every time you trade a new collection, you must pay a gas fee. So that's part of why it would be smart to incentivize people to migrate their listings is because it would cover this gas fee that they're getting charged. So that's a good way to get the FLUF people trading on Universe to offer this incentivization for migrating your listings. Then when the contract is approved so they can always list moving forward for no extra gas fee. And it's as simple as that.

**Nick:** I've seen many talks about LooksRare today; they have just announced that they are going to pay people's gas fees to list their NFTs and transfer there.

So there are just a lot of ways that we can do this.

I iterated earlier that we don't need to focus on making sure our marketplace works before we want to incentivize people to flock here. There's much leeway and workaround that we can do with incentives. I'm sure that eventually we're going to have to incentivize people to list on our marketplace. That's how I feel as a core team member of Universe.

**Trevor:** Yeah.

**Nick:** Sorry, I know I'm echoing and it's hard for me to talk.

**Trevor:** Another idea that we've discussed is possibly allowing people to stake their XYZ tokens to get a discount on the gas prices, similar to what 1inch does. 

On 1inch, if you stake a certain amount of tokens, you reach a certain tier and a portion of your gas is refunded. And then I think another thing that we might want to explore is possibly incentivizing‚Äî The first sale of an NFT that's minted on the platform. That would incentivize people to use the platform and mint quality NFTs on here. And then they would get an incentive for the first sale, but only the first sale because otherwise, you get into wash trading situations as you have on LooksRare.

**Algy:** That's the key. What Trevor was saying. We would love to incentivize every single person to move their listing. But, then that creates the window for people to create new projects and wallets‚Äî creating exploits and scammy situations. We don't want anyone scamming the community or us. We 100% want to avoid that completely.

You guys are right, we don't have to do this airdrop. We don't need to FLUF people or any other community list on Universe because this is early in NFTs. We are so early in this space. If we have a marketplace existing with these better tools and opportunities for artists, that's enough over time for us to have a community organically.

It will not hurt us to notify and incentivize these people who have been trading NFTs and take the space seriously, and are still holding these expensive NFTs. Incentivizing those collections would only help the space. I'm talking about all-time best NFTs. I'm not talking about going on OpenSea right now and looking at the stats page and deduce that those are the ones that are going to get the airdrop. üôÖ

> I mean the top 200 all time; Maybe even narrow some of those out so that it's not fugazi. (Broken beyond repair) 

We obviously wouldn't airdrop every Decentraland NFT, Rarible or Foundation NFT; that wouldn't make any sense. It would only be these smaller projects that have this rarity that is made to match the market, and the market is avatar profile pictures, and that's not a debate. That's a fact. That's what the market wants. Metaverse land is a separate thing. I don't think it would work where we're incentivizing Metaverse landholders just because of how much land exists.

Finding some way to incentivize these, and honestly, people should be renting their Metaverse Land. They should be holding it and running their metaverse land on EnterDAO. ([Landworks](https://landworks.xyz/))

Incentivizing these top 200 profile picture projects, in my opinion, is a smart thing because the communities are super positive. Most of them are pretty organic, and they're all diamond hands‚Äî for the most part. Especially the top 200. That's a super good way to grow the community with people caring about NFTs. It's that simple. 

The XYZ token is a governance token. The point of it is to decentralize the voting process so that we can make decisions moving forward about voting. And it's not anything more than that. So, any ways that we can decentralize things for NFT holders, specifically‚Äî It seems like that's the goal of the token.

**Mark:** Thanks, Aly. The next question is from JVK. He's asking us what things we use. I'll message you. 

Is that AJ? Are you still here?

**AJ:** Yeah. Okay.

**Mark:** So I'm not sure. I think Tyler and Troy left. Are we still doing an AMA tomorrow? Because I honestly would love to give you ten minutes to talk about what you guys are working on.

**AJ:** That sounds good.

**Mark:** Because I saw your question. Yeah. So take it away, dude.

## [Jibaros](https://www.jibaros.net/) [[1:33:15]](https://youtu.be/XGCrJ8x_wYI?t=5595) üáµüá∑ üßë‚Äçüé®

**AJ:** Hello, guys. I'm AJ. I am the founder of J√≠baros, along with my team. Mr. Tranquilidad is here, Joanne is here, and Ellis is here. 

We created the first Culturally Influenced Generative series. (CIGS) üé®

It's called J√≠baros. It's based on the culture of Puerto Rico. We created this because there's a big demand on the market for people not currently participating in the NFT space who would love to participate. After all, currently, in the NFT space, most of the sales are happening between the top 5% of people that are actually in the space. 

Not many people are looking into ways to integrate communities that want to participate in the NFT Ecosystem but don't know where to start. We created Jibaros. It came out of a Hackathon here in Puerto Rico, and we launched it during the Hackathon. Usually, during a Hackathon, you present the idea. But we launched the whole thing, and then we did some brainstorming in order to make the NFT unique. We appealed to the people from here, and right now, half of the holders, it was their first NFT, and we're working on replicating this around the world. As I said before, the 6th concept Culturally Influenced Generative series, we want to create communities worldwide to push the adoption from the ground up instead of like top to bottom.

And when I say top to bottom is that the people that got early on the NFT space, they might have been at the right place at the right time, and they ended up just buying NFTs to show that they can just purchase them because they are expensive and from the ground up. We are proposing the adoption of connecting with different people in different regional locations. So there are things around the world that are pushing adoption. When I say adoption from the ground, we're creating a balance between virtual and digital events and metabolic events. 

We have a small gallery where we do events every week or every other week. And then we're also connecting with entrepreneurs, business owners, and restaurant owners in order to be able to get to the masses. People on the Internet who know about NFTs are just a portion of all the possible people participating in the ecosystem. Next week, on Monday, we have the reveal of our shopping, which is a physical token that is going to serve so people can authenticate that they own an NFT. We give them this physical token so they can participate in the ecosystem.

Then it would be harder for people to try to game the system because not everyone understands MetaMask. Someone could put a picture of their NFT on their MetaMask and then trick the cashier; for example, at this event on Monday, people who show their token will be able to redeem a free burger. üçî 

We have different benefits with other companies and businesses. We're working hard on connecting with the people on a local level because that's what we think, which is going to be able to push the adoption globally. Another of our benefits right now is that every month, people who hold one of our entities, the Jiro, participate in our monthly art drop from different Puerto Rican Artists that might be new in the ecosystem. They've been traditional artists before, and not many people know them yet. Then it's very difficult for artists to do their art, do their promotion, do their marketing, and run social media. So any holder of Jibaro will be able to claim, for example, for January, we have the Three Kings Days installation that we got from Spain.

We had 8 pieces made by 10 Artists because 3 Artists worked on their part. Then over 200 holders were able to go to the website and get 8 NFTs per Jibaro. 

The reason we are doing this since we are all about that option; people need to have material to give away for a low price. That's, for example, someone that has 3 Jibaros; for example, they would end up with 24 NFTs. Our NFTs run on Polygon because we target people not currently participating in the ecosystem. So telling someone that they're going to pay as much or more gas than the NFT cost wouldn't make much sense. But this allows people to send NFTs to other people and then start pushing the adoption from the ground up. For this month, Valentine's drop is going to have the claim it's going to be up on the 21st. People that have one of the first 700 Jiros we're at 640 right now, will be able to get 17 pieces of art from different artists from Puerto Rico. 

We want to do this around the world.

So I'm going to take this opportunity to let anyone know that if you guys are interested in creating a CIGS reach out to us. The main benefit of creating these in different regions is that the artist has the chance to do art for their initial layers and then benefit from the revenue that the whole team gets. When I say a team, the artist is going to work on the art. But then you have people working with social media; you have people working in connecting with other businesses. So we take over many of the responsibilities that NFT artists currently have that they have to do of them by themselves and create a product from it, so they have more time to work on their art. So after they finish their layers and it's launched, they can do backup art to help for promotions and things, but they have to be constantly making art all the time in this Ecosystem that is so competitive. Also, the supply of NFTs it's almost infinite, and then the demand is quite limited. So by creating a CIGS, you're making a product that is not competing for the most part with the current supply because it's a unique product.

And since it's going to have different leaders and teams worldwide, they can push adoption forward. And then these teams end up becoming like, quote, unquote authorities under regions because since they are connecting with artists, they're helping them out, they're pushing adoption. They would have a voice, and then we could have an impact.

**Mark:** This even goes back to what Troy was talking about. 

Tyler was saying, Troy went and spoke today. Much of the stuff that AJ is working on is part of what Troy went and talked about in today's teaching. I know you guys know, but some of us have moved to Puerto Rico. üáµüá∑

Part of what we've been doing is AJ has been trying to teach people about the industry because there are so many ways to benefit. AJ has been helping artists on the island bring and show them you can start a Polygon wallet. You don't need to spend $150. That was something really interesting that I thought they did. That was very easy, and they had very good success. The biggest point that AJ said was a lot of those Jibaros, I still need to get a little bit better Spanish. 

The fact that those NFTs that those people bought Jibaros and they're their first NFTs. The whole point of this is Culturally Influenced Generative Series where we can have people around the world creating together; From Japan to Florida. üèØ üèñ

Florida is big. It could be its own country in a way. Florida has its own culture; Japan has its own culture; China has its own culture. AJ wants to get in touch with everyone Worldwide, and we can start cultural NFTs that represent different people. One of the more interesting things that someone has said to me since I moved to Puerto Rico‚Äî there are ten times as many Puerto Ricans in New York City than there are in Puerto Rico. ü§Ø

In Puerto Rico, many people have moved out depending on their reasons, but they still love their culture. Some of the Puerto Rican people I've met here are passionate about Puerto Rico. But, so many people want to leave; there's an American dream. People want to move to America, but they still relate with the people back home. Not only is that super powerful, but teaching people in some of these other countries where Crypto isn't as easy to access, you're teaching them about NFTs, you onboard, them to layer-2, which is more gas efficient. And that's the whole point of Crypto, right?

Let's onboard, everybody. Let's teach people around the world. Let's bank the unbanked, and let's make an economy that empowers everyone. üòå

**AJ:** The best part is that it doesn't have to be about a state or a country because, for example, we have two teams in New York. One is working on the CIGs of New York. If anyone in New York wants to reach out, I can connect you with them. Then we have another one made by Puerto Ricans in America that was mostly raised there, and he's creating the New York Rican version of it.

We also have a team in Slovakia. We also have a team in Guatemala. We also have a team in Venezuela. We need to keep building this because the part of building teams and brainstorming for the traits works in parallel while we do everything else. When everything is ready, we help them launch the contract. 

I can give you more details later but just go to our Discord if you want to be part of this cultural NFT revolution.

**Mark:** You can reach out to me. I'll get you in touch with AJ. If you're interested in doing an NFT project like this, and want to be involved. 

We want this to be a global project, and part of the reason why we think that this is something is so on ethos with NFTs and Crypto. We're all going to make it in this whole community that we can build Worldwide. This is the perfect way to do it. We can teach people around the world. Many people believe that the people who are benefiting from NFTs are Americans. But the fact of the matter is that anyone can benefit from this technology. 

The people who can benefit from it the most are the artists worldwide. I know we've talked about starving artists. We hope that NFT ends that stigma. We can create this technology that's going to empower people. 

AJ, thank you so much, dude, for coming up. I think we're going to have an AMA with the Jibaros team, and if anyone is interested, please reach out to me or reach out to AJ. I'm going to say his name is JBR 214.

He's in the chat right now, and if I don't respond, tag me in the Discord because I have my DMs turned off. 

You guys can tag me, and I'll get you in touch with them. Dude. Thank you so much, and I think we're going to have an AMA that just on Jibaros and cultural influence generative projects (CIGS) because we believe that this is we believe this is a great approach to teaching people around the world about NFTs.
