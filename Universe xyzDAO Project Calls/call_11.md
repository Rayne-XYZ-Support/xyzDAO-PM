## Intro  [[00:00]]()

**Mark:** Hello, everyone! Welcome to project call number 11 for UniverseDAO. We have some updates for everyone. 

## Polymorph Updates üß´ü¶π  [[00:12]](https://youtu.be/497EfHx4o7k?t=12) 

**Mark:** I'll start rounding off some updates for the Polymorphs. Actually, I'll let Tyler start this because we had some updates to the Rarity charts, and Tyler would like to address the community. 

### Rarity Charts (Patch)

**Tyler:** The community helped with the Rarity charts from the beginning. I believe the original documents‚Äì the excel sheets‚Äì were from our community. We have worked with the community through the whole process. It was a unique way of doing rarity. It's based more on multiple traits and the ability to morph your Polymorph traits. 

Naturally, when we launched it, we had the user interface working. There were some bugs. The community pointed them out, and we patched the bugs. The community was kind of confused about what happened. 

We patched the bug to correct what was already circulating up until that point in time. It was very much a community drive. I understand if people have seen things change over that period. People may be concerned that they change over time. The bug is patched, so everything should be smooth going forward. We don't expect things to change anymore unless there is a specific uproar over one thing‚Äì coming from the community. At that point, we'll put it up to governance to decide. (Either a Snapshot or a DAO vote if it's a major change. 

I think we hit the nail on the head. It should be straight going forward. We appreciate the community helping through that entire process. It was different than other projects, and it was a bit harder. 

**Mark:** The community caught most of the bugs. We tried to go through the entire collection. It helped a lot, we found all the problems quickly. That helped us out a lot. 

**Tyler:** The second set of eyes or ten thousand eyes is wonderful. We love that you all keep a lookout for us. 

**Mark:** We have a few more updates for the Polymorphs.

### Polymorphic Faces

**Mark:** One announcement that we have‚Äì which is pretty sick. I think a ton of people have anticipation for the Polymorphic Faces collab project. We have leaked a little bit of information about it. But, I think it's finally a good time to explain what we are doing. 

We are taking the Polymorph contract and creating a burn-to-mint derivative of the Polymorphs. We will be using dope NFT artists from the space‚Äì that has been creating art for a while and are well known. We are going to allow them to come in a collaborate with us. 

This project is exciting. For all those that did not really like the art, this allows you to burn it and get something that you enjoy more than before. These are getting done by legitimate artists in the space. It is a dope collaborative project. Basically, they are faces that you can scramble, and there are several different sections of the face. 

The artists have already started working. We are looking for a few more female artists to join us. So, if anyone is interested or has anyone in mind. Hit me up on Twitter or DM me on Discord.

- Twitter: [@markwardbro](https://twitter.com/markwardbro)
- Discord: MarkWardBro#3866

We are still looking for people. We are open to meeting new people and getting more on board. Please, reach out to me if you are interested. Don't be shy. I'm not going to bite or hurt. I am pretty nice. I will direct you to the right place and help get you the tools you need. I think a lot of people are excited about that. (Many people have asked me about it)

This is kind of an announcement that we are officially started. So, hopefully, we get that done relatively soon. I'm not rushing the artists because you cannot rush perfection/creativity. We'll see. I am not putting a timeline in place. Just know it's in the works, and you have something to look forward to.

### Battle Game

**Mark:** Next, the battle game contracts are gone. They are getting audited. The Limechain team has battled Polymorphs. They have seen the other side, and they say that it is awesome. They watched Polymorphs on the battlefield, and they said it was next level. So, we are getting excited about this, and we are happy it's getting moved to audits. 

I believe the battle game and the original Polymorph contract went through audits‚Äì at least. My hope is that they go through audits a bit faster than auctions and minting. To give everyone an idea, those are much larger contracts than the others. They get more review time. 

Hopefully, the battle game won't take too much time. Ideally, that gets connected soon, and people can start battling their Polymorphs. It's exciting, and I believe there is a lot of interest in the game.
 

### Polygon Bridge (In progress) ‚Äì Then Scrambling Again üéâüîÄ

**Mark:** Updates on the Polygon bridge that we are building. George has started construction. It's in progress. Stan or one of the others may have some updates for that.

However, maybe George is the best person to answer that? We don't need to answer that.

We will skip that for now.

It's in progress. Once it's finished, we can get some of this stuff moved over to Polygon. Then we can turn scrambling back on.

We are trying to get that back online as soon as possible. Because now that we have the Rarity Charts out, we can let people play around with scrambling and see how everything gets affected. That's one of the best aspects of Polymorphs‚Äì dynamic rarity. 

Some people have figured that out and explored it. They are excited about the potential. 

I will pass it along to Ryan for the auction and minting updates. Those are currently were in audit, and we recently got them back. So, there are some updates.

## Auctions, Minting & Marketplace ü•º‚öóÔ∏è [[07:38]](https://youtu.be/497EfHx4o7k?t=458) 

**Ryan:** Hey, guys! 

### Audits

**Ryan:** So, as Mark said, we got the first round of audits back from Hacken. It has taken a little while because we switched audit firms a few times. We wanted to branch out into multiple sets of eyes. This is our first protocol-level product, so we want everything to be as pristine as possible. Those first rounds came back. We made the changes that the auditors requested and then sent them back.

So, now we are onto our second round of audits. Again, that's for the auction and minting platform. 

We are testing the beta website that we have internally to ensure that everything is working seamlessly. We are examining everything, creating new NFTs, deploying collections, bidding against each other in auctions‚Äì all of that.

### Marketplace (In production)

**Ryan:** While all of this is ongoing, we are working on the marketplace. Instead of auctions and minting, it is closer to a secondary marketplace like OpenSea. You can buy/sell NFTs and place bids. There are a few other features that I won't leak today ‚Äì but we are excited about them.

**Mark:** It will be a lot like OpenSea or Rarible. There will be similar tools‚Äì the majority of them are necessary for NFTs. Like buying, selling or transferring. They are functions necessary for an NFT platform. So, those will be some of the functions involved. Once we eventually build the social tools around the marketplace & auctions/minting. That's when we believe we will fully blossom as a project. 

The marketplace is a major point of focus at the moment‚Äì after launching auctions and minting. We would like to have it released as soon as possible so everyone can use the platform. 

Thank you, Ryan!

We have one more update today.


## Lobby Lobsters ü¶ûü¶û [[09:57]]() 

**Mark:** This is a brilliant update. We have an NFT drop coming up next week!

We have been working on it in the shadows. 

Tyler or Aly, do you want to bring this up?

**Zee:** Alpha leak alert...üö®üö®üö®üö®

**Mark:** Tyler was a part of a Twitter thread for this.

**Tyler:** I don't think I was directly tweeted. It was Kain Warwick he tweeted at the Universe account.

The way everything was headed‚Äì I think the majority seen what was happening with bills in Congress in the United States. The people who are not listening to that or are not from the US. (Like a lot of people on this call) 

Some lobbyists are working with various people in DC. In attempts to help them understand blockchain technology (DLT), DeFi, NFTs and everything we are all so passionate about. Naturally, there are older people in Congress that do not understand these technologies. It was attacked by certain Senators.

I believe, even yesterday. I saw some things passed that several people were unhappy about. Kain from Synthetix or Hayden from Uniswap were talking back and forth. Someone suggested doing a drop with the proceeds going towards lobbying efforts in Washington. I believe Kain since he is involved with Universe, tagged us and then I direct messaged him on Telegram. (Because we talk, quite frequently)

He helped champion the DAO first concept, and when things come up, he is a great person to discuss ideas with. Since then, we thought it was a unique idea. We want to support the ecosystem and lobbying efforts. We want people to recognize this technology and what it does. So we can get good regulation or help push education. We've been working with Hayden & Kain.

We have been doing a ton of design work. We adjusted the concept to make it more friendly and open. 

Basically, we are doing‚Äì [Lobby Lobsters.](https://universe.xyz/lobby-lobsters)

It is a fun project that goes towards lobbying efforts and education. We are going to donate the proceeds to groups that are specific to this exact situation. Some of the ones we are working with have asked that they not yet be named. They don't want the drop to be reflective of them. The funds go to a multisig. The community will know, and we will decide where everything goes. We will work together when it comes to the ongoing resales. 

If lobbying ends up being something that has run its course, then there may be other charities and things that we can do with the funds. It is not a drop that is meant to bring money back towards the DAO treasury. It's something that is built and then put towards good use for the ecosystem. 

**Mark:** Yeah, for sure! This drop makes a difference. Where everyone can be a part of it. We are donating all (100%) of the money. We are not keeping any. It goes directly towards donations. 

It's something that seemed like a great concept, and we jumped on it. We wanted to be a part of it because we believe it will help the space. 

**Troy:** Does Aly have anything he wants to add to that?

**Tyler:** Yeah, Aly has done a ton of work on all the details.

**Troy:** A ton of it!

**Mark:** Aly can tell us! Can you give us the general drop dynamics?

How many there will be, the cost etc.

### Drop Dynamics

**Aly:** I can do that!

There will be 10,000 of them. We are going with a price range of 0.1 ETH.

As you guys said, the funds are getting used to empower decentralization. The entire point of the drop is to bring something fun to the space. It's a simple rarity‚Äì not like the Polymorphs where you can scramble. 

They will have typical rarities that the market is used to. It should be a lot of fun for everyone. We had like eight artists or more on the team making them. A decent amount of work went into the artwork. We didn't have to put anything on hold because we happened to have everything timed out perfectly. (Schedule for creation)

The developers were busy, and the artists were not. It's not a lot of technical work. It will be a fun drop that will be good for the whole space. It empowers decentralization. 

**Nick:** How many are people able to mint at once?

I know people are going to want to know that. It's always a question.

**Mark:** I think the most we allow to get minted at once is a batch of 20. (There is no limit on the number in your wallet)

**Nick:** Okay! I know people ask that, so I am saving us some time.

**Tyler:** We are also releasing a Medium article. Last time people complained that the article came out ten minutes before. But, we kind of did that on purpose with Polymorphs‚Äì because they are so different.

This time we are working on getting it soon. I don't want to put a timeline on it and pressure the devs. 

**Mark:** Early September. That is good, and if we can drop them earlier than that, we will!

**Tyler:** We will likely drop the Medium article on the day that it launches. We will try and do it a bit before. Ten minutes prior was probably not enough time. We will likely drop the article an hour or two ahead. But, we don't have a set date. 

**Troy:** Once we set the date, I don't think it's a bad idea to allow people to know that it's coming soon. 

Once we have that date‚Äì letting people know a day or two in advance doesn't hurt anything. 

**Tyler:** So everyone knows, when you start asking questions about what charity gets what. We worked with Hayden (Uniswap), Kain (Synthetix) and other people in the ecosystem.

**Mark:** Yeah, like Santiago!

**Tyler:** We all worked together to figure out what the best group would be. The group that we are donating to asked to not be named before for the drop. They don't want it to be seen as something being dropped by them‚Äì they greatly appreciate the effort. They want to work with us. But, I understand and respect that decision. Just know we will say who it is going to be. And the community can help us decide where the ongoing funds are dispersed. (Resales)

We are not going to say who it is because the charity specifically asked us not to. I want to be transparent with the community. It's not for lack of transparency. We want to respect their request. They are the group that everyone agrees is the best to handle the funds. So, we will respect their wishes because we believe they will put forth the best effort for the ecosystem. 

**Mark:** Yeah! We want to better the ecosystem. This drop is a unique way to raise these funds. Everyone knows that NFTs are popping right now. This drop is a great way to give back and help create a better future for crypto and decentralization. That is the main goal for this drop.

That's the last thing we wanted to discuss. I'm going to look at the community questions.

## Community Questions ‚ùì [[19:05]](https://youtu.be/497EfHx4o7k?t=1145)
(Questions from Discord in channel #project-management-calls)

**Mark:** Nice, we got some questions!

**Question**

> I have a question about burning polymorphs to mint polymorphs derivates. Will this work also the other way. Will we be able to switch back to polymorphs and burn the derivates? üëÄ

-Resistance-

**Answer:** Okay!

So, no, you will not be able to switch them back. But, if you burn your Polymorph to a derivative. It will still technically be a Polymorph. So, you can burn that derivative for the next one. 

**Tyler:** We shouldn't call it a derivative because it's not a financial derivative. (So everyone knows) It is an art derivative.

There is a meaning for that word in art. For example, Andy Warhol and his artwork of Cambell's soup cans. You use it in intellectual property conversations when talking about derivatives of someone's art or parities of other works. It means that its artwork derived from the original Polymorph drop. Some of them may look like Polymorphs or advanced-looking derivatives. Some may be completely different abstract versions.

I would like to clarify for everyone. I'm aware that a lot of people follow NFTs and DeFi. However, these are not derivatives in the financial sense of the word. We are talking about an artistic derivative of the art and technology we began with. 

We will come up with another way to describe the new versions. I don't want to use that word because I don't want to confuse people.  No offence, Mark. I only wish to clarify that. 

**Mark:** It is an industry term, and it was a part of the question. (How it was worded)

Tyler is right. They are derived from original art. There is some correctness there because it has multiple meanings‚Äì with a palpable difference. 

**Tyler:** Like 'Spin offs.' 

We will come up with a better way to word it. I want to clarify for anyone who is listening and maybe confused.  

**Mark:** Okay, next question.

**Question**

> Is there a chance you will consider doing community calls to takes questions and drop updates?

-Slade45-


**Answer** 

**Mark:** Yes, we will do that. This is what we have been doing for the last twenty weeks. Just join our project calls, Slade45! üòã 

**Tyler:** We will keep doing this!

If you are asking if we will answer questions on the call, we will keep doing that. 

**Al:** I hope he sees the call!

**Everyone:**  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

**Mark:** The best part is the 'JohnLowbill' hits a plus one on it! (In agreement and would also like to know about project calls)

**Ryan:** I think they may want a Twitter space situation where they can ask questions. Not necessarily typing them out. (That could be what they are referring to)

**Troy:** You can do that on Discord. 

**Tyler:** At BarnBridge. We do Open Office hours on top of these calls. I am down to start doing that. We are going to be busy as hell for the next two months. 

We have auctions & minting to launch. There are additional audits that we did. After the first audit firm, we wanted to be more comfortable and get a second set of eyes on the contracts. Both of our internal teams are looking through all of the code. There is a ton of front/backend work to get done. 

Along with the marketplace coming soon, the Lobby Lobsters drop was a fun drop that we figured was good for the ecosystem. It might have set us back a little bit. We also have all of the spin-off work coming out.

Even with Polymorphs, we ended up delaying auctions and minting. We wanted to get them launched. We will be slammed for the next sixty days. I don't suggest that we do this for at least ninety days. As the community grows and more people come in‚Äì I think we can adopt something similar to BarnBridge. We do Open Office hours, Discord stages. People can jump in and asked questions. 

We will make ourselves available twice a month for an hour timeslot. People can get used to it and know when they can hop in and ask questions. (Instead of our current format of recording it for the community and then sending it out to everyone)


## Important Announcement Regarding Operational Security üîêüö® [[24:17]](https://youtu.be/497EfHx4o7k?t=1457)

**Tyler:** Another important thing. Moving off that concept and since we are discussing Discord-related matters. 

One of my friends got a ton of NFTs swiped from his Metamask. Various NFTs like BAYC. After a Metamask debacle. (< 1 M USD)

**Mark:**  It was a UR code scheme.

**Tyler:** Metamask discontinued the feature that allowed you to scan a specific barcode. After someone manages to get the barcode, they can scan it and somehow can derive your private key from it. 

I was not even aware of this scam.

However, this is the important part. **Someone in our Discord did get scammed.**

Something happened with his wallet, and it wouldn't connect to our interface. It was three in the morning. (US time)

He went to our Discord, and someone impersonated a team member. That person somehow tricked this other person and stole the assets from their wallet. (Nearly 70K)

I want to be completely clear, whether it is on Telegram or Discord. It is your responsibility‚Äì this is being your own bank. We cannot stop people from impersonating us on Discord. We cannot prevent fake accounts. There are several on Twitter that replicates my name and team members. There are fake accounts that pretend to be projects we are attached to. 

You need to be careful and verify that you are actually talking with someone from the team. Say you are talking to me, and you believe it is me on Discord, then tag me in general, asking if it is the real me. 

You can see my verified badge as one of the Discord members. If I'm talking with you, I will have no problem responding. 

Be safe, don't get scammed. But, it is not our fault if you do not follow proper security procedures and practice smart operational security. If you have been scammed, it falls into a Discord problem, and you may have to talk with them. Please know. When you think you are talking with someone on the team, you may not be. (Even if they are one of your friends)

Someone can be talking with me every day, and still, someone will create a fake account. We feel terrible when it happens. But, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do if it happens. The Metamask problem that happened‚Äì with the OpenSea community was patched. (As far as I know)

They will get more creative. Scammers are going to scam. You have to look out for yourself and verify who you are talking with. Make sure it's a legit team member or part of support staff. (Be diligent)

So, that is what it is.

**Mark:** Yes! And we will never ask for your private key or sending us any money, ETH, tokens etc.

**Tyler:** If anyone asks you for a private key. Or for you to send them any money‚Äì **at any time.** 

- Private Keys‚Äì NEVER SEND IT TO ANYONE 
- Money‚Äì Rarely, find the context, reasoning and make sure you verify in the Discord.

If you mention that a person is talking to you about something sensitive like this, we will act quickly and ban the person. If they are scamming, phishing, or even trying to do those things.

So, use the official Discord and check the name tags and colour system. You will know who the admins are and make sure that you are talking to the same person. 

Again, DON'T GIVE YOUR PRIVATE KEY TO ANYONE. EVER.üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üö®

Maybe your mom in case something happens to you. But, don't ever give away your private key. Not even to your best friend.

**Mark:** Yes! Exactly.

**Nick:** I want to add to this. Guys, these scammers are clever. They will come. 

I had one approach me from a Discord with around a thousand people. I haven't talked in that Discord in three months. However, someone still knew I was friends with someone on the team. So, he was attempting to impersonate him and come through me.

I had no idea how he figured out that we were friends. So, they are intelligent. They will come for you. That is what they do. They say precisely what they think you want to hear. They will say anything to get you to send them money. 

**Al:** It is always believable. You won't get them to admit to it.

Another thing to add to what Tyler said. If someone DMs you asking for anything‚Äì it does not matter what it is. No one should ever DM you first asking for something. That is bad form. If anyone ever does that, be suspicious.

**Nick:** If anyone ever asks for you to send them money first‚Äì it is a scam.

That is pretty much across the board.

**Mark:** I do DM people, but I won't ask you for anything. 

**Tyler:** If you are going to send money‚Äì be diligent. 

Never exposing your private key is crypto 101. Nobody needs to know your private key in any scenario. Coinbase is not going to ask you for your private key. 

**Troy:** Yes, exactly. 

**Tyler:** If you send money to someone, perhaps someone sees one of my Polymorphs posted, and I say I will sell it. As soon as I say that, a scammer that could be in the Discord will DM you. So, basically, have a conversation with me. 

Tell me to say something like; Hail Mary or Fluffy Penguin in the general chat. That way, you will know it is me. You can see me as a verified person say that.

**Troy:** The largest attack vector is the socially engineered process. The majority of attacks happen through communication on a one-to-one basis. You can try and find advances through ports. But, usually, what happens, people are tricked through social engineering. 

Even the best hacker that was the most wanted at one point ([Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick))‚Äì all he did was socially engineer these attacks. Typically that's how he gets through most systems. You need to watch that and protect yourself from it. 

As Tyler said, be your own bank is a mantra in crypto. So, there is not much you can do. There is no system support for retrieving funds. If someone takes your private keys or anything like that. You cannot call a 1-800-Ethereum number. There is nothing like that. 

So, take care of yourself and understand, people will try and attack you when you have something valuable. Don't give out any information if you do not know who that person is.

**Mark:** Also, if a team member is messaging you. The best way to ensure it is legitimate, go to the Discord, click on our name and literally DM us. 

Say, Yo, I think someone is scamming/impersonating you. 

As soon as you message us, it will create a new DM. If you have not been contacted by the right person. If you have clicked through from the labelled users on Discord. (It says Core Team‚Äì Coloured green)

If the message didn't come from us, then it is a fake person/impersonator. 

**Al:** Yeah! I have had a Tyler Ward account DM me and say, "Hey, something is going on bro, I need you to send me 1 ETH, really quick!"

I responded a few times. I almost sent it. The reason I didn't was because of what Mark said. I considered that I was about to send this person 1 ETH thinking it was Tyler. Then I quickly checked the Discord, and it was not him.

I couldn't believe I was even responding to that person. So, they will get you to respond.


**Ryan:** With this particular case, the person direct messaged Algy, myself and a couple of other team members. 

Typically, there are four numbers after the name. (#----)

The four numbers after the name actually matched with the ones that Tyler had. So, the only way to know that it was not him. Was to do what Mark said. Direct message the person through the roles list in the server and verify that it is the correct person. (It should not start a *new* message)

If you only cross-reference IDs, it seems that scammers may have figured out how to duplicate those numbers. Perhaps the name is slightly different, yet the ID number is the same. 

At the end of the day, you need to be super careful. Sometimes cross-referencing is not good enough, and you need to message them directly from the server to check if it begins a new thread.

**Mark:** I will never care if anyone sends a message asking about impersonation/scams. We will never disregard your message. If you believe you are getting scammed, DM us! Make sure the message came from us. I will tell you right now, it did not. Because we will not ask for ETH or private keys. We don't want them. We have private keys.

**Tyler:** Tyler definitely does not need them. 

**Nick:** And we also have ETH. 

**Mark:** Don't send Tyler any more ETH. Send it to me. Jeeze.

**Nick:** That is why my name on Discord is $XYZ burn address wardn.eth if you want to send anything. 

Send it to wardn.eth

**Mark:** Yeah, wardn.eth is the burn address. 

**Tyler:** I have enough ETH. I don't need any more guys. 

I will not DM anyone from the community and ask for ETH. EVER. I promise!

Neither will Troy. And honestly, anyone on this call. Be careful out there. It doesn't just go for us. I seen the other day, the lead dev at Aave had a person impersonating Stani. The person said essentially asked him to stay up late and started discussing matters of programming. The dev posted the conversation. The scammer was clever. 

The scammer said that he needed to test something, and so he was in need of ETH. So, it happens across the board. It is not limited to our Discord. Take this as a blanket lesson for all Discords and Telegrams. It's a part of crypto. 

Scammers exist. The Nigerian prince is real. 

**Mark:** I think they found that guy. They found him, and he had all this money he was trying to share‚Äì but no one ever came. 

**Nick:** He was trying to 'share it.' I bet.

**Mark:** Alright, I think that is everything. Hopefully, everyone got to the end of this call and got to hear about the scammers. It's critical, but we cannot fix it. Ethereum cannot fix it. You have to stay safe.

Also, don't click on links. If someone sends you a link, don't click it. People send me links all the time. I never open them. Don't download files.

**Nick:** Even if it looks like an OpenSea link. I have heard of people clicking on malicious OpenSea links.

**Mark:** You can make a link say anything. I know how to do that. 

**Nick:** Same with PDFs in your email. If you do not know where it comes from, don't open it. It doesn't have to be executable. Even a package that comes to your house. Don't open random things that you are not expecting or anything that executes data inside of it. (Like a PDF)

**Troy:** 100% PDFs are gnarly.

**Tyler:** PDFs can embed things in your computer. If a person sends you one, ask them to send you a screenshot of what they are trying to show you instead if you do not interact with that person. 

**Mark:** Yeah, if they are not going to send a screenshot, be careful.

**Troy:** Steve Jobs used to say that PDFs were viruses.

**Tyler:** Alright, we are coming up on time, everyone. So, if you want to learn more about this. You can search for how to be safe on the internet.

It's a brave new world out there. 

**Mark:** Alright, everyone!

**Everyone:** üëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëãüëã
