## Intro

**Mark:** Hey, everyone, welcome to Project call number 20. 

This is the first project call of the year. 

After an awesome holiday, everyone on the team is well-rested and recharged, and we have hit the ground running. 

## Proposal [PID:4](https://dao.universe.xyz/governance/proposals/4) 🗳 [[00:18]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=18)

**Mark:** We're going to dive right into updates. We have an active proposal on the forum right now. We're about to push that to the DAO. I'm going to let Troy give an update on this and kind of what it's about. Take it away, Troy.

**Troy:** Right now, there's a proposal for minting more tokens to reward the development team who didn't get rewarded in the first round of token distribution, to align incentives. 

We have a pretty good [forum post ongoing](https://forum.universe.xyz/t/mint-4-to-limechain-7-to-multiverse-and-2-to-new-team-members/52/33). If anyone wants to look into it, there's a forum where we talk about it. We're also minting for some new team members, so all incentives are aligned across the board. The other mint is for Multiverse (now Graviton), which is the company that the VCs are putting capital into. I have to leave it at that. 

However, briefly, they are for governance. We promise to return tokens. They're not there to be sold— if it implodes. We can vote on proposals through an entity to show examples. If you want, there's another excellent forum post about that specifically. We break everything down. I've had conversations with a bunch of you in the Discord. I think everyone's pretty up to date on it. It seemed like it went over fine. The other thing— we need to pay [Fleek](https://fleek.co/), which is our decentralized web hosting service. We want to pay it directly from the DAO and not from a company. So we stay decentralized as much as possible. That will have to be done every year. It's only $420 of ETH. We will pull that out of the treasury and send it to them directly from the DAO. That's pretty much that. If you have any questions, I'm on Discord, you can ping me, or I'm pretty good on the forum right now. If you put anything in the form, I'll get back to you within an hour or two.

**Trevor:** Do you want to talk now about what Multiverse (now Graviton) is doing?

**Troy:** No.

**Trevor:** Okay.

**Troy:** This is a protocol development call, not a business call. It has to be separated.

**Mark:** I will attach the link to the forum post for anyone that isn't familiar with how to get there. I'll throw the link down in the bio. Then everyone has it.

We will hand it off to Ryan and Iliya to go over minting, auctions and marketplace updates.

## Products: Minting, Auctions & Marketplace 🧑‍⚖️ 🖼 [[03:10]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=190)

**Ryan:** We're going to be rolling out a whole bunch of things over Q1 22. We will kick this off with the basic minting flow to release. Minting is followed by the marketplace and then the auction house. If you'd like to, I can let Iliya give some more details about the auction house.

**Iliya:** I don't want to leak alpha now, but note that we'll have some data released for you guys to check out. We will appreciate your feedback when that happens. We'll keep you posted on Discord, I guess. Hopefully soon.

**Mark:** That's super important because, as you know, we have been working on this for a while. It's very important for us to get extra eyes on this. And obviously, some of the best reviews we've seen have been from the community, so they have been extremely helpful to us. Because when you've been building something for so long, it's easy to overlook something.

**Troy:** It's also better to have a bunch of people battle-testing it. There's no way for one person to do it quickly— it's not easy for one person to do it. You can, but it's a massive process. If you have many people breaking it, it's much easier to iterate and find what to focus on.

**Mark:** Exactly, so we can't stress that enough— we appreciate the participation. So we'll have announcements and all sorts of posts about how to get access to the beta. We will most likely be releasing it to everyone. During the beta time, we will be looking for feedback on how to improve the platform and fix any of those edge cases. Then push out the full product over that beta testing period. So over the next few weeks, we will have a lot of updates being pushed and a ton of code being released. This is the moment we've all been waiting for. It's exciting times at Universe right now. 

## Yield Farming 🚜🌾 [[05:28]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=328)

I'll follow up with what I've been saying on the last few calls. There are a few XYZ farming opportunities you can go over to [League DAO](https://dao.leaguedao.com/yield-farming) and [Enter DAO](https://dao.enterdao.xyz/yield-farming). Also, you always have the [Universe DAO governance opportunities](https://dao.universe.xyz/governance/overview). We are about to push that forum proposal to a DAO vote. If you have any of those tokens in any of those farms that you would like to vote with, you have to move them before the vote starts if you want to.

Otherwise, you won't be able to vote with any of those tokens in any of the other farms. If voting is something you feel is important, like myself, I like to move my tokens out of the farms to vote. I'm speaking now to give everyone ample time to do that. At some point today, we'll be pushing that proposal live. 

We have one more major update. 

## $XYZ Merchandise 🌌👕 [[06:47]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=407)

As you all know, or maybe some of you know, most of the team is from most original. I mean, not even most of us on this call, I guess, only Troy and I worked at Barn Bridge. We had a Barn Bridge partner for merchandise, we've aligned pretty well with him, and we were very happy with how the merchandise went for Barn Bridge. We created a similar situation with Universe, where our merch partners will handle the merch. I wanted to show everyone this site quickly. Because it's sick, I want to say this isn't a Universe brand, but this is the most affiliated we can be with them without being these guys.

They have complete rights to use the Universe brand. This is the official Universe merch from this company. I'm going to go ahead and show you all this site. This is pretty sick. This is [Degen Supply Co.](https://www.degen.supply/) It used to be called something else, but our merch partner nailed it with this excellent branding. 

> [Click here for a link to Degen Supply Co. Twitter](https://twitter.com/degensupply).

Right now, Universe XYZ will be the only gear available right away. But Barn Bridge and, ideally, some of our other projects aligned with us. Like Enter DAO, League DAO and [Fiat DAO](https://fiatdao.com/). Maybe they'll be able to use our merch partner too. We think we have a pretty cool system. It's going to be easy for everyone to get gear, and we have distributors all over the world. 

We've solved a lot of our logistics problems, and we have faith that we're going to be able to get this merch out to everyone much quicker than last time. (When we did the Barn Bridge merch) The slight difference was when we did the Barn Bridge merch, and it was a limited edition run. All the original Barn bridge gear is limited edition. You can't buy it anymore.

This Universe XYZ gear. And probably whenever we do more Barn Bridge gear. They will have a few set pieces that will always be available. With that being said, we will expand and do super unique and very exclusive merch. We will work with our merch partner to come up with neat ways to integrate clothes with NFTs in the Metaverse. Our merch partner has the capability of doing much more than clothes, and the [Bored Apes did skateboards](https://twitter.com/boredapeyc/status/1451359546149163008?lang=en). We have the capability to do stuff like that. 

Our merch partner knows how to get it made if you guys can think of it. There are a lot of cool ideas—a lot of creative things that we can do as a community. I know in Discord, we do have an idea channel and a gear channel. If you ever have any ideas, go in there. I know the merch partners go in there, and they do read the feedback and interact with everyone. It's a neat way to be a part of the gear. If anyone ever wanted to submit some designs or something, go ahead. This is a community project, and we want everyone to be involved.

One of our artists came up with the design of this hoodie that you're looking at right now. 

![Universe XYZ MERCH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99563566/157167471-30bb88a2-1574-4485-a552-21f81b4abdcf.png)

And our merch partners loved it. They said, whoever, if anyone in the community wants to come up with a sick design and contribute to something like this, they're willing to work with us and get something extraordinary made for the whole community. 

They also want to do unique NFT merch. Eventually, we'll have Polymorph merch exclusive to people with a Polymorph. For right now, we're going to slow launch this Universe gear with a regular marketplace. But eventually, we're going to have all the excellent tools. Then we will try to integrate real-world gear and Metaverse gear. To try and figure out the best way to do this.

**Troy:** That'd be dope to combine, Metaverse gear, and then you have it in the wet world.

**Mark:** The thought is when we have things like Supreme and the Yeezys, what if they made those limited editions and you had to own them? Well, there are two ways. First off, they're limited edition, and you get an NFT when you buy the asset. ([Adidas is getting into NFTs](https://www.adidas.ca/en/metaverse)) We can see this possibility, Kanye West sells me these shoes, and I get an NFT that proves I own it. Then I can bring that asset into the Metaverse. 

What if I bought a Lamborghini? 

And they said; 

> This real car, comes with an NFT, and now, you get to play with it in GTA.(Or another video game)

**Troy:** You get to have a legitimized NFT. (TRUE FORM) 🦾😼

**Mark:** I'm going to play Forza, but I don't have to unlock this car because I own it in real life. 

**A verifiable NFT that proves I own an asset in real life. Now I don't need to play to earn in your game to earn this. I already played to earn in real life and earned this.**

**Troy:** This is taking down the whole play to earn. No, I do that in real life. ✌️

**Mark:** That's what a job is, right?

**Troy:** Exactly! 😂

**Mark:** I saw a pretty funny tweet the other day. It said, what do you call a play-to-earn game that sucks?

**Troy:** Reality? 😅

**Mark:** A job. Yeah. 😂

**Troy:** That's good. That's pretty good.

**Mark:** All right, so let me wrap this up by going into the community questions.

**Troy:** Before we wrap, can I say two things?

**Mark:** Yes, whatever you need.

## Internal Updates— Perspective Change [[13:53]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=833)

**Troy:** One of the things I want to mention is that we are talking about moving a lot of this into AMAs— *within the Discord.* 

We're going to have our first trial run of this tomorrow. 

Tyler posted something in the Discord. I forget what time it is. And we're trying this across a couple of different protocols, but we want to do this with Universe. Tomorrow will be the test run. We want to move a lot more of our communication to the Discord, so the community feels more involved, and we can kind of pick people up as they come through that are in some way invested and want to help out. 

If the trial run goes well tomorrow, which I feel will go pretty well, I think we'll be doing them a lot more. AMAs might replace this call completely and we will record the AMAs the same. We'll throw them up on Youtube still. But, they'll be through the Discord, instead of behind-the-scenes communications.(Via Zoom calls) 

That's one thing. 

## [Sharded Minds: Enter DAO NFTs](https://sharded-minds.enterdao.xyz/) 🤯🧠 [[14:56]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=896)

The other update we have to mention is that since we got some Lime chain guys on here, they are having a giant printing of their [Sharded Minds— Enter DAO NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/sharded-minds).

The pre-sale starts 35 minutes from now. Which is 12:00 A.M. AST time. (Puerto Rican time) Then the main sale happens. The public sale will happen at 1:00 P.M. Eastern. (10:00 A.M. Pacific)

This video should be out by then. If you get this, or if you see it before those times, head on over to [shared-minds.enterdao.xyz](https://sharded-minds.enterdao.xyz/), and you'll be able to mint. We'll likely add that to GitHub. We can add this to the agenda, Mark. If you can— link everyone in the bio.

**Nick:** Add it to the bio on YouTube, too.

**Troy:** Yeah. There you go.

**Mark:** George, do you want to make a short little pitch on Sharded Minds?

**Troy:** Yeah, I'll give it to the man. Go ahead.

**George:** Just buy it. That's the pitch.

Just buy it.

**Troy:** That's the best sales pitch ever. Do it, ape in! 

**Nick:** I'm sold.

**George:** Without promising too much, as far as I'm able to say, Sharded Minds will be more useful than beautiful. And it's going to be f**ing beautiful.

**Troy:** Yeah, it's beautiful. Yeah, it looks awesome. I can't wait.

**George:** You're going to have massive utility, at least inside the Enter DAO ecosystem. We are exploring our options and figuring out how they will have utility outside the Enter DAO ecosystem.

**Troy:** Nice, there you go. All right, we'll get those links up and put them in the YouTube bio. We'll tweet something out on Universe, too, since it's coming up. 

Those are my two big updates. If there's anything else, do you want to go over, Mark? Or anyone on the call? Do we have some Discord questions?

**Mark:** Yeah. Does anybody have any other updates they want to bring up?

I can jump into the questions. There are some good ones.

**Troy:** Okay.

## Community Questions ❓ [[17:01]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=1021)


### **Question:** [[17:10]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=1030)

[Resistance](https://twitter.com/reesistancee) asked us if there is a way we can implement a better UI for the XYZ airdrop. Everyone's kind of been checking out the [Fiat DAO](https://app.fiatdao.com/airdrop) and [League DAO](https://dao.leaguedao.com/airdrop) page.


#### **Answer:** 

**Mark:** Yes. We have already started working on this. We have designs in place, and we're going to implement them within the next week so that everyone has a slightly better UI. A little bit more information on the airdrop. I agree those widgets and the charts are pretty cool. That's a good way to represent the airdrop and its location.


Another guy asks when the next project calls are happening. It's happening right now.

**Troy:** Right here, live and in person.

**Mark:** Okay.


### **Question:** [[17:59]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=1079) 

Will the marketplace allow mechanics where little marketplaces, for example, a marketplace for one collection. Plugs into the XYZ marketplace? So, what you're asking is; 

Will the XYZ marketplace be open source so you can use the code to build a smaller marketplace?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Yes, we are.

**Troy:** Exactly the idea, 100%. 

It's like a clearinghouse, contracts for the whole market, for the entire ecosystem. Using the contracts sort of rewards the DAO. That's the grand idea— the contracts become a clearinghouse for NFTs. One operated everywhere. Not a silo-ed thing.

**Mark:** Hopefully, this will become a standard where not everyone needs to build their marketplace. We see many hypotheses right now, suggesting that many marketplaces will go vertical with niche marketplaces. OpenSea is almost something you could consider a super marketplace. It's like a Walmart. You go into Walmart and look at the shelves every day to spot the new items were on the shelf; you would have a hard time doing it. 

If you had to go to a hobby store or a store with lower inventory— like a sports authority or something. It's only sports items. —you go in there, and it'd be a lot easier to tell what the new items are on the wall. There's a lot more focus. I believe we will see a lot more marketplaces split like that. Although, it's unlikely that people will want to build their own. Building decentralized marketplaces isn't an easy lift.

When you make this code open to everyone, they can easily take it, and the back end will host all the hard stuff. Then you can build a beautiful UI that caters to the marketplace that you want to build. Inevitably people have asked me, Do you think marketplaces going vertical will hurt Universe? And I always say no, it's what we built Universe for. 

All this will naturally happen. We have foreseen this, even with a game like Immutable X or Parallel. Eventually, there will be so many assets for those games that you're not going to be able to go to an OpenSea. If a game has 100,000 assets, it will need a marketplace for the sake of the players of the game. It makes it easier for them. That was a good question.

**Ryan:** Suppose I could jump in and add some comments there. I see three ways that somebody can integrate with our marketplace. They have the easy mode, the medium mode, and the Hard mode. This option is available to all creators, depending on their technical skills if they want to find someone with the technical skill to work with.


1. Easy mode: You can use Universe as a white label solution. 
   - You sign up as an artist, and you can get your own landing page on our platform where you can sell your NFTs. You can have your own ecosystem within our ecosystem. That's the most common route most artists will go down.

2. Medium mode: The middle ground between that and running a marketplace will be hooking into the Universe APIs. Again, it's open-source. Anyone can hook into them. They can say, I want to put this item for sale— whether they're running a trading bot or their own marketplace for their NFTs or a host of NFTs. It doesn't matter. Whatever the use case. Users can grab the orders from our site as well.
   - If you want to display orders on Universe on a personal site, you'll have that option too. On both sides, the orders that exist and creating new ones. Then you can handle all the matching. So that's cool.

3. Hard mode: This is for anyone who sees how open source Universe gets. 
   - For example: Trying to run this specific marketplace to do a specific task. Universe put out together all these tools that let me do that. They can go and clone down our back end. Then hook that into our contracts or hook that into contracts they deploy themselves. It's all up to you what level of customization or configuration you want. We provide all kinds of options.

**Ryan:** It's up to you to decide:

*Easy mode, medium mode, or hard mode.*

It will depend on your use case and kind of what you're trying to accomplish. However, you have the option for each one.

**Troy:** Yeah. I would appreciate it if you use the contracts, though. That would be cool. Yeah. That's a good breakdown, Ryan. Thank you.

**Nick:** We worked hard on it. And it's a lot of code. I will add that last part that Ryan said. You need a little bit of technical skills to do what he's saying.

**Nick:** It's up to your skill level and how far you want to go with that.

**Ryan:** Yeah, most do not need to go the route of running their own using our stack. Those who are trying to work on the cutting edge or trying to get creative without reinventing the wheel have the option to do it. (At the very least)

**Nick:** I'm running easy mode. Suppose I'm running my NFT. I'm an artist, but I'm not.

**Mark:** We have another question.

### **Question:** [[23:41]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=1421)

Billy 2.0 asks; How long after the NFT Marketplace launches do we expect to see the team try to go cross chain with it? He says, clearly, it's hard to judge a time period, but do we have maybe an estimate of years or quarters?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Yeah. It may be a year before we have a cross-chain, fully cross-chained marketplace.

**Troy:** Are they specific about cross-chain, or are they also saying layer two? Because layer two, if it's EVM compatible— It's workable.

**Mark:** Yes, we are talking about cross-chain.

**Troy:** Okay, yeah, the cross-train chain. Then, yeah, that will be around a year.

**Ryan:** There are no current plans; Buy a Polygon NFT without ever leaving the mainnet. 

That's something we can add in as places like Multichain and others get routing together. If the routing exists, we can hook into that. That's coming together over the next few months. There's a lot of progress on what [Multichain](https://multichain.org/) and others are doing. I do expect we'll have options to hook into.

In probably the next six months, I don't know when we'll integrate there on the L2s and side chains. We're looking into them. I'll speak more philosophically than I will on timelines. I've been making the point with the team a lot; we've been having many discussions on layer two solutions. Much of what we're thinking; Layer one marketplaces are designed for layer ones. Meaning they're built to be usable even with high gas fees and all the other trade-offs that exist when dealing with high security but a lower usability chain. For the side chains, the transaction fees are very low. This allows us to build out a marketplace in a way that operates slightly differently from an L1 marketplace. It has different features and makes sense to be running on layer one.

We do have lots of plans for these L2s and side chains. We want to do it right. We don't want to roll out a layer one marketplace on an L2. We don't see that as the optimal route to go down.

**Mark:** I think there was one more question. All right, this is a good question.

### **Question:** [[26:00]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=1560)

Will there be marketing towards lead up for the launch? Are there any plans to incentivize people to use Universe over other marketplaces?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** All right, so I'll answer the first question.

**Answer:** Yes, we are definitely going to kick up our marketing. We haven't been marketing for the last few months. We thought we were going to launch our products sooner than later. However, honestly, it's kind of hard to market a product that's not out. I feel like it annoys people sometimes. It seems like we've been building this for a while, and some people are ready. But, literally, our releases are around the corner. Over the next six weeks and beyond, we will be marketing a lot more. You'll see us more on Twitter and engaging with other users in Discord. (More active in the Discord server) 

Part of our marketing strategy is to move tons of our work, calls and syncs into Discord. I know this doesn't sound like marketing. Although, it is. It creates community engagement which is the best marketing that you can get in crypto. Bringing our workflows, the team calls generally trying to move our processes into Discord. (Over the next six months to a year) That way, we have full transparency. People can help easier and come in and help us work.

We're going to see a change. All around, you're going to see us seem like we kick it into another gear. We've been building quietly. Now we're going to start being lively. We're moving a level of operations into the Discord. So, it's going to seem like we're working all of a sudden. But, we're moving where we currently work from. We work from an app called Slack. We believe that there's a disconnect of communication. Other DeFi projects have done this. I believe [Synthetix](https://synthetix.io/) is run entirely through Discord. That is part of formulating a DAO. 

How do we decentralize everything? How do we decentralize the token? How do we decentralize the marketplace? How do we decentralize decision-making? How do we decentralize work? How do we decentralize communication? There's a ton to consider when trying to decentralize everything at the protocol level. We think this shift is critical, which is why we're taking preemptive steps.


#### **Answer TLDR:** 

**Mark:** We're kicking it up on the marketing. We have some other plans, and that's one of them. To try to kick up community engagement.

Troy, I don't know if this is a question we should answer or maybe just.

**Troy:** What is it?

### **Question:** [[29:32]](https://youtu.be/yCuMugf6bFo?t=1772)

Are there any plans to incentivize people to use Universe over other marketplaces? I know we have talked about potentially doing something.

#### **Answer:**

**Troy:** We have some ideas. Let's leave it at that.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Troy:** I don't want to get into it, but we have some ideas.

**Mark:** Okay. We'll leave it at that. Thank you, Jerkass.

**Troy:** People can read between the lines on that one.

**Mark:** Thank you. Jerkass for the great questions. I love it when people have these awesome Discord names. Like Jerkass. 😂😅

**Troy:** It's a great name.

**Ryan:** Our direct incentive— a superior product. As long as we get a whole bunch of listings on our platform, the product will be superior. Then the customers will come.

**Troy:** For Sure.

**Ryan:** Incentives are awesome, and we will talk about that when the time comes. (If it ever does) To me, the most important incentive has a functional marketplace that doesn't pull any of the BS that others might be pulling. That's my take.

**Troy:** Yes, 100%, better product.

**Mark:** Don't forget about the Enter DAO NFTs. The first Enter DAO NFTs.

**George:** Don't miss it, or you will miss out on a bunch of stuff, as George alluded to earlier. I think I don't know. I'm getting like a bunch of them. If you want to be like me, Troy and Nick. Buy em'

**Mark:** All right, everyone.

**Troy:** I listen to you guys. I do whatever you guys tell me to do. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I'm like a zombie.

**Mark:** I don't think anyone knows what they're doing.

Whenever someone says, "Oh, you know what you're doing with NFTs?" I say, first off; If anyone says they know what they're doing, they're lying.

**George:** I realize that I'm too old. I have an army of wonderful people around me. Like Alex Holmes, Nick, Ryan and Mark to tell me. I copy them if this makes sense.

**Troy:** Yeah, that's what I do. I copy them at this point. Basically, okay, tell me where to ape.

**Iliya:** It sounds like everyone is copying everyone.

**George:** Yeah, I'm copying these guys. Alex Holmes is a distance relative to Cheryl Holmes; he should have made it already. He knows what's good.

**Troy:** It's elementary. Elementary. Dear, Watson.

**Nick:** I'm going, to be honest. Everyone copies someone: everyone, even me and Aly. We're copying Gmoney, Tim and Jimmy, all the greats. I mean, you got to learn from someone or be following someone. I don't care who tells you what.

**George:** Yeah, and I'm copying Ryan on Olympus stuff.

**Algy:** When I buy NFTs, all I do is, look for the project that I feel is definitely going to rug my wallet. I ape that the hardest. 🦍😅

**Everyone:** 😂😂😂😂😂

**George:** I'll trust you on that.

**Algy:** This time I'm going to ape Enter DAO NFTs and not get rugged. It's going to be a nice change of pace for me.

**Everyone:** 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

**George:** Yes, for once, you might sleep 2 hours at night— without feeling that your wallet is already getting rekt.

**Algy:** It's not that I think they're hacking me. It's that I have a tendency to buy random projects where the whole team disappears right after I buy the NFT. Then the rest of the NFTs don't sell out. I'm kidding.

But for real, the Enter DAO NFTs are going to be sick. By the time you see this part of the video, you're going to have seen me shill the hell out of it today.

Do you know what I'm saying?

By the time you even hear us talking about this, you're going to be like, Algy has already said this in the Discord like 30 times.

**Mark:** Yeah, the key to NFTs is to follow the Fluf rabbit down the rabbit hole.🕳🐇

**Ryan:** Delete this alpha right now. It's too much alpha. 🙅␡

**Mark:** All right, we're ending this call. Thank you, everyone. ✌️

**Troy:** All right. Talk to you soon, everyone. See you at the AMA. 

**Ryan:** Bye guys! 👋
