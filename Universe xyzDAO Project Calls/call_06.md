## Intro [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/IZG1eB5zevw)

**Mark:** Hey, everyone! Welcome to Universe xyzDAO project call number 6. 

We're excited to have everyone back and listening to our updates. Today will be a somewhat shorter call– we are in limbo waiting on some things for our audits and an NFT drop.

We'll dive right into audits. Tyler and I will give a few updates.

## Audits 🛡️📋[[00:28]](https://youtu.be/IZG1eB5zevw?t=28)

**Mark:** Right now, we are currently auditing our auction and minting contracts. Along with the 'Polymorph' contracts. 

The Polymorph contracts get done on June 21-22. Ideally, everything comes back perfect, and we can get everything connected and released ASAP. 

Our audits came back from Hacken. I believe we spoke about this last week. (on project call #5) 

We had to make a few changes. I'll let Tyler talk a bit more about this. 

Essentially, we told Certik to wait a bit on the current audits. So we can address those issues and then allow them to resume as soon as the changes get implemented.

**Tyler:** Yeah, sorry, there is a lot of noise– from construction –where I'm living and my apologies if anyone can hear it.

There is a feature that we are adding for the protection of users on the platform. Hacken thinks that introducing this feature in which we thought would add security, actually introduces some vulnerabilities.

So, we are working on how to have our cake and eat it too. We want this protection on the platform– I'm not elaborating on the feature.

But, we are trying to figure out a workaround that lets us introduce this feature without creating a vulnerability. It's probably set us back around two weeks in terms of working together and playing around with different architectural designs– trying to see what works best. It's coming, and the rest of the audit was clean. 

As a result of the setback, we prioritized Polymorphs over everything else. So we could launch with something quickly. I'm not 100% sure about the timelines. However, I said in the Telegram. It won't be July when we start shipping stuff. We likely start shipping some things in June. (at the end) And naturally, we'll roll out additional aspects of the protocol/platform. 

**Mark:** Yep! And to reiterate, we take all of this pretty seriously. We want to get everything audited and double looked at– as many eyes on it as possible. Security is something we take extremely seriously. We are waiting on the audits and kind of in limbo. 

There are other things in production. But, we know everyone is interested in the progress. So, that's where we are trying to give updates.

Next, we'll roll into what a lot of people are most interested in– Airdrops.

We can let Ryan take over and talk about that.

## Airdrops 🚁🎁 [[03:54]](https://youtu.be/IZG1eB5zevw?t=234)

**Ryan:** Hey, guys! 

With the airdrop, as most of you already know. It's 8% of the total supply distributed through a 20-week airdrop– with a sweet dynamic I'll elaborate on in a second– essentially, the airdrop is going to the early Discord members that were here in February and the bidders of the OG NFPs. 

So, that comes out to;
- Discord Members: ~309 (6%)
- Bidders: ~216 (2%)
- **Total:** ~525 Airdrop Participants

So, each airdrop is either 6% or 2%, depending on whether or not you are a Discord member or a bidder. It comes out to about ~190K or ~90K tokens per person. If you were both, then you are getting around ~280K tokens.

But the kicker is, those token amounts are not what you may end up getting. If you claim early, for example, the first gets ~10K tokens. However, if you wait the entire 20-weeks, whatever the amount is, you'll receive that and a portion of the others who forfeited their drop early.

There's a possibility you end up with– at most 50 mill tokens –if it played out perfectly and you were the last one to claim, it won't play out like that. But that's one possibility. 

It's anyone's guess how it will look. Again, you'll have the ability to claim roughly ~10K tokens at launch or wait and see what you end up getting. It's kind of like yield farming, except you don't need to pay gas to compound and stake. 

You can go to the website and claim whenever you are comfortable with the amount.

**Mark:** Nice! We'll have updates when it goes live, and people can first claim.

Have we decided any dates on that?

**Ryan:** We are not doing timelines on this call for the airdrop. 

**Dragos:** That's still being decided on, but we'll follow up with more news about it– don't worry. 

**Mark:** Okay, perfect! 

The last thing on our agenda to talk about is NFT drops. Those are coming out and in the works.

I'll let Tyler talk about this. The teams have been somewhat sealed lips on our next project. 

We'll let Tyler talk about that.

## NFT Drops 🖼️ 💧[[06:32]](https://youtu.be/IZG1eB5zevw?t=383)

**Tyler:** The sealed lips aspect is painful for all of us. We want to tell everyone what we are about to drop. But every prominent NFT drop that is successful like Meebits and Bored Ape Yacht Club. They are not doing pre-marketing. Because by the time people see it, they lose interest. Or they may have already seen it. 

We'll have documentation and everything with the launch. Although, other than knowing that the name is 'Polymorphs.' I don't think we should say anything else until the day we drop it. 

**Mark:** Yeah. Also, the OG characters are moving along. We've gotten them far. Unfortunately, there's a reason we are not moving forward with the OG characters sooner. It's because we want to use our auction and minting contracts to launch them. And as we said earlier, we need to wait on them to be audited.

The Polymorphs have a contract for themselves. So we can move forward with them. That's the catch– so everyone knows why we've decided to move forward with the Polymorphs.

I think that's most of our updates. We can check out the community questions and see if we have anything. 

## Community Questions ❓[[08:00]](https://youtu.be/IZG1eB5zevw?t=480)
(Discord Channel #project-management-calls)

**Mark:** It appears that we have no questions. 

The only question was;

> "When is the next project call?"

**Tyler:** Now. 😂

To answer the question. 

I have a feeling a lot of people want to know a few things about the airdrop. And so the community knows, we hopped on a call before this one, and then we got the expectation that this would be a short call. 

Primarily because we are about to start shipping a lot, so we were expecting these to be quick updates. 

However, did we go over the timelines for the airdrop? 

I think that's what 90% of the people who are listening want to hear.

**Mark:** We don't have timelines yet. But, we'll update everyone as soon as we get information on that.

We'll put out a Medium article. If it's before the next project call, we'll let you know. 

**Tyler:** It probably won't be in two weeks. 

I think our next step, Bogdan needs to talk with Milad and go through the token dynamics of the distribution for the DAO before we sign off on a go date. They're coming. 

**Dragos:** Bogdan?

**Tyler:** I said, Milad. 

**Dragos:** Nevermind...😂😂😂

That's it exactly! We are through it.

**Tyler:** Nice!

**Mark:** Sorry for the short updates, guys. But we are working!

**Tyler:** Yep! 

Alright, guys, we can all hop then. 

**Mark:** Thank you, everyone!
