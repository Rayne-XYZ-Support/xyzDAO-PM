## Intro

**Mark:** It's AMA time the music will stop. We can entertain everyone until Tyler, Troy, and everyone joins.

**Ryan:** Game time. What time is it? Polymorph o'clock.

**Mark:** Polymorphoholics in the chat

**Ryan:** *Polymorphoholics anonymous*. 🫠

I need that in my life. Dude, the polymorphs are one of the first NFTs I was buying. Right? Because I was like, right when I became a DeFi person and my mom was like, please don't get addicted to spending all your money on these, and I think it's only gotten worse from there.

**Mark:** Yeah, it's hard not to spend all your money on this.

**Ryan:** No regrets. But it was how it played out.

**Mark:** Oh, I have no regrets. I think I own over 100. My only regret is that I wasn't spending all my extra money on them. I guess.

**Ryan:** I don't regret sending them to all my friends for NFT-NYC, but one of them listed it on LooksRare to get the airdrop and messages me is like, dude, my polymorph left my wallet. So I checked his ether scan, and he accidentally sold it on LooksRare.

**Mark:** Not going to make it.

**Ryan:** Not much I can do. There. You listed it to get that airdrop.

**Mark:** No man was left behind.

**Ryan:** Well, he got left behind.

**Tyler:** What did he sell it for?

**Ryan:** .05 😬

**Tyler:** Not going to make it. Polymorphs are doing great.

**Mark:** Yeah, they're doing awesome. They're as cute as ever.

**Tyler:** There's a monkey on the floor with a gun and a sword. I might go shopping.

**Mark:** One thing that I want to talk about with the Polymorphs.

There are always people asking questions about them. What's the best one? What's this? What's that? 

I want to be clear, we're going to build out a lot of tech, and I don't know for certain. We could be building games for the polymorph for 5 years. So to say one is better than the other is hard to tell right now because you never really know what or which trait or which thing is going to be overpowered in a certain game. I can say the lightsabers right now. The lightsabers are an item in the polymorph Universe that doesn't belong to a set. So what we did is we weighed it heavier in the game because obviously, a lightsaber is a pretty powerful weapon. 

Still, it's one of the contributing items to Rarity, unless you have dual lightsabers because they don't match a set. We have a pretty crazy rarity system, but I don't know how to explain this. One thing that may be rare or super-powerful now could be less rare or powerful in another game or another thing we build because we try to build as much logic into this stuff as well as we built the polymorph game.

The ripped zombie shirt isn't going to give you a lot of protection in the game, so we gave that one not a lot of defence. But zombies are pretty crazy, and they'll attack you even if you shoot them. I don't know how you kill a zombie. That's a pretty speculative thing, right?

**Ryan:** I'm not sure how to effectively handle the zombie problem.

**Tyler:** Yeah, it sounds like you haven't watched enough zombie movies. You shoot them in the head or cut their head off.

**Mark:** They're like a snake; the fingers keep wiggling. I'm just kidding. I don't know. 

Okay, so I think most people have joined. Is Troy in here? Maybe not. I think we can go ahead and get started. 

## Merging; Projects calls ➡️ AMAs [[5:16]](https://youtu.be/AujNpydtEX8?t=316) 🤝

So the way we usually do this for people is by hopping on or watching the Universe calls online. So one idea that Tyler had was that we wanted to start these calls, making them more community-centric. One thing that we wanted to do was just go ahead and merge our project calls with the Discord AMAs because we had really good feedback from the AMAs, and people seem to like them. So at the beginning of these calls, we'll just run through our normal project style updates, and then we'll answer some of the questions. In the process, we'll probably have everyone direct their questions in the **Pre AMA** channel and leave it open throughout the week. Then everyone can go there and post their questions. Then we'll start addressing the questions when I get in there. Last week people posted questions, and we'll go ahead and answer them too. Eventually, we'll cut it off because this is a recorded call.

We'll want to upload it to you so everyone can watch it. We don't want to make them too lengthy. We do want to open up the end of the call to these open discussions because we want everyone involved in Universe to be as involved as possible. We think that this is one of the best ways to do that and to start working more transparently. We want people to be able to come and contribute to our Open-Source Protocol because that's essentially how DAOs need to be. 

It'll take some learning, but I think we're on the right track. We have a good plan of how we're going to decentralize the transparency, how we're getting work done, and when things are rolling out—allowing— people to come in and help a little more so that everyone knows what's going on over Universe. I guess we can go ahead and start with our updates. 

That was number one on the list to go over this new call style. These are going to be uploaded to YouTube every week, like our Project Calls. Because we'll do these at 3, 4, or 2 in the afternoon, it will sometimes depend on our schedules, but we will try to make it consistently at the same time. We know not everyone can join us, but we wanted to make it friendly to you and the Western United States, which is, I think: it's 01:00-12:00 in California, right, and we wanted to be aware of everyone's time. We'll record them, but I think the time works for most people. 

Everyone can give their feedback, but I don't think we'll time this call because we record it, and there are a weeks worth of questions. It's a good system, and everyone can join if they have the time.

**Tyler:** Are we recording this one?

**Mark:** Yeah. Zach already has started recording this. 🎥

**Tyler:** Nice.

**Mark:** We'll have some music before the Project Calls if you hop in early talking about FLUF or FLUF Alpha. 

Before this call, we talked about a little bit of stuff going on and speculating some other NFTs. We'll be in the Discord a little bit early if anyone wants to hop in and have a fun discussion that will not be recorded. We will eventually start recording and posting so everyone has the ability to watch these calls. 

Next, we'll roll into the Updates and Marketplace. I'll go ahead and go over some of this, and then if Ryan wants to jump in at all, he can. 

## Updates; Marketplace [[9:27]](https://youtu.be/AujNpydtEX8?t=567) 🖼

**Mark:** As everyone knows, we launched our minting last week, and we feel like we had really good feedback. We had a few issues on the front-end, and we want everyone to know that those Minting Contracts we could say were essentially bare, but we have a lot more features coming out soon. One of our founders, [Tim Kang](https://twitter.com/illestrater_), has been putting in a lot of effort and trying to get awesome Minting Contracts written out, and he's been taking that on himself to add new customizable NFTs and NFTs more for the artist.

Eventually, Tim will tell us about many of those new Minting Features, but the front-end is priority, right now, but those contracts are done. So we're going to figure out when those are going to be squeezed out and released. I want everyone to know that what you see isn't completely what you'll get. We're going to be launching more and more types of Minting Contracts and more features as the community requests them, and our developers and our founders bring code to the table. Tim wrote his Smart Contracts and worked very closely with other big names in the industry like [MonsterCat](https://twitter.com/Monstercat) and [Manifold](https://twitter.com/manifoldxyz) to build contracts that are artist-centric and that are for artists.

We want to keep focusing on that and bringing updates to the front-end that people from the XYZ community bring forward and request. Something super powerful about that is the XYZ token— it's a governance token. We can vote to have all of this, any front-end feature or any type of Smart Contract feature added. We can all put a proposal in and vote together.

We've had some extremely good discussions in our forums over the last few days. 

> [Link to forum](https://forum.universe.xyz/) 🚨

People are talking about doing an airdrop, but essentially that's up to the community if we do that. That's the very powerful thing about Universe being a DAO— we need to keep moving in our direction. We will truly have a community-run marketplace that we can all take pride in and say we built it together. 

That is what we want to do is build an open-source community project. That everyone will be able to build together and build on top of. And move forward as an NFT and DeFi and all this cool stuff that we're working on Crypto scale. I also want to address some of the options updates. People may not realize that we're working on a few different types of platforms that the industry hasn't quite seen. One of them is the [Justin 3Lau](https://twitter.com/3LAU) style drop that he did last April. Justin just released an album and had certain different tiers of the album and people were able to go bid on those tiers. 

*Multiple NFTs can be in those tiers, and you could have multiple winners in each tier.*

So Justin, I believe, had like one gold album, five silvers and twenty regular additions. That was for 25 spots in the auction, and each person that wanted a slot got multiple NFTs that were locked to the tier. It's an excellent auction style. We wanted to give artists the ability to take zero fees on these auctions because auctions are slightly different from listing something on the secondary market like; OpenSea. That's why foundation and some of these platforms are more focused on auctions because the artists want to launch these single works and see what the market will price it at. 

It's a weird thing to be price art; how much should I sell it for? It's a weird question for artists to ask themselves or ask other people. Essentially the best thing to do is auction it, and OpenSea had auction reserves where art couldn't go for less than an ETH, and that was one thing that we wanted to fix.

How do artists gauge the fair value of their art? 🧑‍🎨

That was one thing we thought about and we didn't like the current state of auctions and wanted to fix that. There's no reserve, but there's no Universe set reserve. This type of Auction goes 0% to the Universe Marketplace. It's just a way for artists to be able to go and figure out truly what they can get for their art. The NFT platform can take a massive percentage like Foundation does. It's like 15, 30% on some that people are launching. So that's one thing that we wanted to do for the artists. 

If you're launching an NFT on our auctions that you made yourself, you're going to get 100% of the proceeds for that. I think that's something that sets us apart. I'm pretty sure the contract is up, but Chuba, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but essentially even if I wanted to go, if I had 5 Bored Apes and I wanted to auction all of them off, I'm pretty sure I can get 100% on there, too.

It's a different dynamic than listing it. You can take your chances on an auction and see how much a Gold Board Ape is going to sell, and you can get 100% for it, or you can list it and wait for someone to buy it and take the Market Fee. That's a different dynamic. I'm willing to sell this thing in the next 24 hours. Let me list it and see what it goes for versus I want 1000 ETH for this Gold Board Ape. I'm going to list it as someone, and when they're ready, they can buy it. So we try to think about how this whole dynamic works and how other people should be able to use these. 

**We think that the auctions we made are for artists, but we couldn't technically  exclude secondary sales. So we just said, let's do no fees.** 

But the marketplace, I think there is a little bit of a misunderstanding about our marketplace. So, our Auction House is going to have 0%, and we say if you're an artist and you're going to sell your artwork, we're going to have 0% fees, but our **marketplace** is going to have a **small fee**.

But we look at the marketplace as being a secondary market. If you want to sell your own NFTs or you want to mint them on Universe, we'll give you the ability to auction them. But most people are going and making their own, for instance, Bored Apes and Cool Cats. They were all minted from their own Minting Contract. So most people we see continue to do stuff like that. But most one of one (1/1) artwork isn't minted like that. 

So when you go make a 1/1, we'd assume that you want to try and auction it, but we're already expecting that most NFTs on the marketplace has already been sold to someone, if that makes sense.

Chuba, maybe you can explain this in another way that may make more sense.

**Ryan:** I am jumping in a little. I think Mark is getting to the point and how I see the auction house is a market to facilitate price discovery. 

It is really useful for artists when they don't know what their content and their art is worth. It's very useful for, say, a large [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) collector who might have a whole bunch of pieces that are not priced at the floor, for example. It will let you as a collector go and facilitate price discovery for these more unique bundles of NFTs that have not been either sold in bundles together or even have a history for themselves. I imagine there are going to be lots of other use cases that will arise from that, as there's much flexibility in how you can set up an auction. You could just sell one of one in an auction all by itself if you wanted to. You have much customizability, but ultimately it helps facilitate price discovery. When you're listing there, the marketplace, you put up a fixed price. It's not as useful in that regard, which is why we're trying to point new artists toward the auction house instead of the marketplace.

In the marketplace, I see where all the secondary volume will be going, and that's where people will trade the art they've collected. Of course, a level of price discovery happens in the marketplace. Still, it's very different, that initial spark or for stuff that has very little price history or previous activity, like rare Art Blocks, as an example. Ultimately, there's no way on a contract level to tell if it's a resale or if it's a primary sale. So for the Auctions Contracts, we just keep it at no fees. And for the Marketplace Contracts, there will be fees, but of course, these will be competitive and lower than, you know, what anybody else is taking across the board.

**Mark:** Okay. Thank you, Chuba. 

That probably sounded a lot better explained. Our other updates will be timelines which are auctions are going to be probably within the next 2 weeks. We are looking at squeezing some features into the Auctions Contracts had some discussions about it this morning. We are exactly what those are, but it may add an extra week to the auctions if we decide to go with that. It's not going to add any time for the marketplace, but we are suspecting that the marketplace is 5 to 6 weeks out if everything goes to plan. Our audits have looked good so far on everything that we've released. We haven't released any of our audits yet because they have been done privately. But as we roll out more of our documentation and logic about how to connect to the APIs and all of our audit information and all of that stuff. So just know that everything that we do release has been audited. We aren't releasing the documentation right away, so just bear with us.

**Ryan:** Mark, with a few comments on the market, I can talk a bit about what we're focusing on right now in the sense that we're working on a few major components, one of which you guys have partially seen an early beta version of minting, which is the NFT Scraper.

It is undergoing some really heavy updates right now, and we're all excited to see much improvement on that front. The other very important side is the order book side, where a lot of our innovation is going right now. That's also where we're prioritizing the ability to integrate easily. So, for example, other traders will be able to come in, plug into these APIs and run their own existing liquidity, providing bots on them; where it gets really important, in my opinion, is the ability for Genie, Gem and all these other NFT aggregators to plug into us and show our listings on their dashboards. 

If we're offering lower fees than the rest of the market and there's liquidity at the floors, it becomes clear where you want to be trading. Hopefully, that will be pointing more and more volumes towards the Universe Marketplace over the other ones. So that's where my recent excitement has been focused on.

## Governance & Yield Farming [[23:27]](https://youtu.be/AujNpydtEX8?t=1407) 🏛 🧑‍🌾🌾

**Mark:** So we'll roll into updates on Yield Farming, just because I like to give everyone updates about the token. So like always, you have the ability to govern the protocol. We have had some proposals going on recently, and we are probably going to start having a lot more now that we have the marketplace and everything rolling out. 

We'll start seeing a lot more forum discussions, snapshots, and votes. We'll start discussing many more things like, What should we be adding to the platform? What kind of things should we be doing?  This is the power of being a DAO. 

What we can do with governance is essentially the heart of the Universe, and whether we want to build together or not, we have that ability. We're going to be able to build whatever the community wants and votes on. Even if the team disagrees, if it's something the community wants, it's the DAO, and that's how it's going to work.

If we all vote together and it's the consensus, it will happen. We're not going to see dictator-type decisions here at Universe like the other day with OpenSea when they're like; we're going to make 50 NFTs only for every collection. It's like you guys would never have seen something like that here because we have to put a vote in to make a decision like that. We as the team just can't make that decision. We can be out-voted, and that's the important side of governance. 

League DAO is ending pretty soon, and this is the last week that you can farm EnterDAO tokens. It may have already ended. I'm not completely sure. 

Enter DAO is ending, and I believe we may be a farming token for the ASTO, the Altered State Machine token, but I'm not 100% sure on that, but we might.

The last thing we want to go over is just some polymorph updates. 

Nick, Algy, Zach and everyone can hop in here and say, we have kind of been quiet, and also, we're sorry; we refocused, and we've said this a few times.

We recalibrated our focus for launching this decentralized marketplace, getting these minting contracts out. 

## Polymorphs [[27:08]](https://youtu.be/AujNpydtEX8?t=1628) 🤡

**Mark:** We've been working for 8-9 months. We dropped Polymorphs— I think, back in August or July. 

We have over 1000 hours of work on Polymorphs. The new Polymorph Scramble Contracts are made. We just haven't had the time to deploy them because we don't want to pull everyone's attention away with what most people in the community seem like they care about, which is the marketplace. So we've started focusing and have been focused on it since October. We thought we were going to launch in October and November, and we had some issues that we had to resolve. 

Now we're finally to the point where we're about to launch, and we have many updates for the Polymorphs. 

We've built a game ourselves. It's more of a mathematical odds game. It's not like I'm going to control my Polymorph type game, but we made that game a few months ago, and we've seen a lot of awesome games get built in the space, and we have been in the process of building a second game with Lime Chain. George is building a pretty awesome game.

We have two games in the works. One is finished, and it's more of an odds-based game where you're going to be able to bet on your polymorph, and you're wagering to see if your polymorph is going to beat the other polymorph in a battle. We're going to use Random Number Generation. We'll post a chart explaining how each weapon or armour is weighted because each item in the Polymorphic Universe will be weighted slightly more. I was saying before we started the recording, we were having some conversations in the chat about like, or maybe we talked about this at the beginning of the call. 

We want to focus on making the Polymorphs as equal as possible. In this first game, we made the lightsabers pretty powerful because, essentially, the lightsabers are one of the less contributing items to Rarity, Unless you carry two lightsabers. The lightsabers don't go with any of the sets, they aesthetically go with the ninja outfit. It looks like a Sith Lord, but it doesn't technically add any Rarity if that's what it's combined with. So we made the lightsabers one of the most powerful items in the battle-game.

We tried to make it as logical as possible. We did talk about this because Tyler was talking about the zombies. The armours is powerful for defence, but they're going to slow you down on your attack. As for the zombie shirt, it's pretty good at attacking, but it's a ripped shirt. It's like something Kanye West would wear. It's not going to give you major defence. In the next game, we make something else that may be more powerful. Almost like the way FLUF World does it, where they don't underlook any trait because you never know what trait is going to get airdropped some cool thing that only that trait gets. 

For instance, the POTAs, The Pixel Of The Apes. They get much cool stuff for your FLUF World. I own a POTA. I think I got a brick thingy.

It has like these Lego brick backpacks, but you never know. I mean, that's not a trait on the FLUF. I guess maybe the mansion background would have been better. It says on the mansion that if you look in the description, these FLUFs only get the best, but who knows? We're going to make much tech is the point of this conversation, this rant, and we are going, you never know. Everyone's like, damn, I want to clown, but I'm a full set, maxi. 

I think full sets are the coolest thing. It doesn't matter if it's Clown Charles, but I'm biased. Chuba, don't shoot me. Chuba is a Clown Charles maxi.

**Ryan:** True, I am. I can confirm. ✅

**Mark:** So I just want everyone to have faith. Don't write off the polymorph. We're going to be doing a lot; I would say 1000 hours of work. We have 3D models going 2D, like sprites, that can go into different types of metaverses. They were built for George's game, in which you're going to be able to control yours and be able to fight each other. You're going to be doing stuff. But George is probably going to kill me for even leaking. 

**Ryan:** Let me just reiterate that we've collectively put in 69,000 hours into the Polymorphs because we like the morphs.

**Mark:** Yes, we like the morphs. Okay, so we're done. That would have been our project call. 

Then this is when we're all like, all right, see you later. But we're going to do community questions now, and we're going to open up discussions. 


## Project Call Questions [[33:45]](https://youtu.be/AujNpydtEX8?t=2025) ❓

**Mark:** We are going to start with the project call questions because that's usually done on the project calls. I don't want these people who posted their questions here to feel like they got rugged— because some of these questions are pretty good. 

### **Question:**

This one's pretty long. 

Bob, dude, you gave me a long question; I was wondering, do we have plans of releasing staking pools in the meantime? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think that would get eyes on us. 

We have the DAO staking pools. We have the LP Incentivization Pool. We have talked about trying to get some ideas on how to use the XYZ token. We haven't decided. There are some ideas in the community. I mean, we have DAO staking. We have LP staking. If you're looking for staking opportunities, I say that's the best. 

You have Enter DAO; you have League DAO.

Also, you have Altered State Machine coming, I believe, XYZ; we've tried to align ourselves with some of the better NFT projects on the staking side. 

Bob, I would stick to these calls and try to listen in as much as possible because we try to tell everyone about those. (When they appear)

Okay. Then let me see if there are any more questions.

### **Question:**

This guy says my knee hurt. How will XYZ fix this? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I was kidding— but he did ask that. 

## Pre AMA Questions [[36:08]](https://youtu.be/AujNpydtEX8?t=2025) 🙋

### **Question:**

**Mark:** We'll go to Pre AMA now. 

All the Universe team, I guess, unmute, and we'll go ahead and start answering these questions. I'm going to slide up here. I think Ben Franklin has the first question.

**Ryan:** Yeah, I can touch on that.

**Mark:** If you like, about the vampires attack.

**Algy:** His question is; What is the plan to drive demand to the marketplace?

**Mark:** Yeah, I mean, we can answer that question.

**Ryan:** I'll start there. 

### **Question:**

How is value being accrued back to XYZ token holders?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** With the Polymorphs, there is a treasury built by the original sale, which is in the Universe DAO and the XYZ token holders own, and the secondary royalties flow there as well.

So continued success of Polymorphs does accrue value back to the XYZ DAO. The FLUFs are a different story. That's not our project, but because we're partnered with them, we hope for their success, and we will do our best to integrate with them as we can.

**Mark:** Nice. Okay.

**Algy:** I remember having a conversation with him. His question was, he sees a lot of big names on our team page that he is familiar with. It felt a little trolling. But I feel like he did make some good points. 

It was basically;

### **Question:**

How can we connect with these people? We have these names on our website. But what are they doing to help the Universe, and what are our plans for marketing in the future? 

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** I can't speak to any specific individual, but every person listed on the website has contributed in some way, shape or form, and we hope that they'll continue to contribute and provide value to the DAO. 

We imagine that because they're all stakeholders in the DAO, once the products are released, they'll have personal interests to ensure success as well as the rest of us. I think that's a good position that we have such a strong community and a slew of stakeholders involved in the DAO. So I don't see that as anything but a benefit to the community.

**Algy:** What many people want when they just start thinking about how a person can help is what many people want. They think, oh, they could just be posting about us. That isn't true, and from experience, just having somebody post about us isn't helpful. So it's way better when this is how we communicate with our contributors. We get into a relationship where we're trying to benefit each other mutually. And the way, it's more of a friendship that we have with all of these.

I don't know; it's not a paid show. Not many good projects do that.

We want to build together the type of relationship with these people. Many of those artists are just waiting for us to have the right tool for them to use.

Many of them see us as a beacon because it's tough for musicians and even artists to make money. NFTs have created this opportunity where it can be consistent for artists and creators in general. Many of these big names, you see them as celebrities, well, they're ordinary people, and they want to have tools that work the best for them. That's why they contribute to us. It's not because we hit them up, and we're like, Yo, we want you guys to help us. It was more of a mutual thing where they heard about what we were doing and wanted to get involved. And we want as many smart people involved as we can get. As simple as that.

**Ryan:** We're all in the same boat. We all are very passionate about NFTs. That means we've all been trading on OpenSea for some time, and that means we all have our own personal reasons why we may or may not want a decentralized alternative. So anybody on that page and anybody you talk to in the community is very passionate about building decentralized marketplaces for NFTs because we're so passionate about NFTs themselves, the art, the tech, and the potential in the future for them. 🙏

### **Question:**

Are there any concerns with the XYZ token having no utility like Looksrare? Do holders get profit shares? What's the reason to hold XYZ?

### **Answer:**

**Troy:** This is an ongoing conversation on the forum right now, and I've put my opinions there. 

There is a lot of a legal weird gray area with that, and we don't want to talk about it too much, but like rewarding fees back to token holders. You start to get into legal gray areas of securities and things like that. So I don't know how Rarible does it. I know that Resistance had put that in there that they do, and I haven't had time today to research that. My days right now are insane. I'm working from 6 in the morning to 10 at night, so I just don't have the bandwidth to do crazy research on that. But I have worked for other projects that have done similar things, and every time they do that, it becomes just this legal quagmire. 

As of right now, I think going in that direction before we have all this ecosystem built out entirely, I think it will cause more of a headache. I fully support many of these kind of— collection focused —vampire attacks in that forum.

I think it's smart, but the token's utility without giving away too much is because we don't want to leak everything we're doing. I think that there will be other utility built into it very soon that will put this delicately, how it will temper the expectations of getting rewards or the want of getting rewards. I'm going to leave it at that. I know people probably hate me when I do this, and I post this in forums, and everyone's like, well, just tell us what it is, but we just can't do that right now. That's my opinion on this. I'm not the only member. I'm not the largest owner. I'm not the biggest person. We are a DAO, and I'm here to listen to everyone elses opinion. My name is on it in many ways. So that might hold a little bit more sway. But I'm here to listen to the community about this. And if you can come up with ideas around how to do it, I'm all ears.

**Ryan:** Troy, is it okay if I jump in without getting us into any legal hot water? 

Anything like redistribution or anything like that. Or any of these weird dynamics that do become trickier— on the surface —we can say that the marketplace has fees. Those fees are pointed at the DAO. And I don't think I need to say any more than that. I think that speaks for itself to some degree.

**Troy:** The protocol does collects fees, and those fees go into the DAO. And how those fees are redistributed is up to the DAO. If the DAO decides long-term, they want to do something. I don't want to say extreme, but if they're going to do something, I don't think anyone is not going to listen. But core team members are going to express their concerns. So it's not that we don't want to. It's just that there are things that have to be considered. LooksRare is anon. We are not anon. People know where this is coming from. They know that we are. 

**Mark:** We don't even know if what they're doing is legal. 

It's as Troy said; they're not a doxxed team. If we do stuff like that, the repercussions fall back on us as the team and the founders. We just have to tread lightly and be careful. Anything that we do or say around this type of stuff. Until there's a little more guidance or even more insight into what is going on with some of these types of protocol incentivization, we can't even honestly say that we know this isn't just full-on loss trading. Still, we're not going to accuse other protocols of that. But there are articles on the Internet that say this stuff is fake numbers, and people can do that, and even that's even more legal. No one has the answers to these things. And if you go try to do some of this stuff, you're just driving a bike on one wheel. You don't know. You might be able to make it to the other side, but if you need to turn, you're screwed. But I don't know.

**Add Speaker:** We can jump on to the next question.

**Troy:** The thing is that I would much rather get these things up and running and going and decentralizing them before we get to that point. But it is important to know that it's not that the marketplace isn't collecting fees. It is built in there in some way. We're collecting way less fees than OpenSea. We are a magnitude slower. So these fees can then be used for collections that want to come to the protocol. There are ways to redistribute them accordingly. If it goes to all the token holders because there's a token, it just gets tricky. So we need to think through this, and we need to think smartly about it. And I think there's going to be stuff that's included in the ecosystem that will temper this sentiment. I do think that. So I just want to leave it at that time.

**Mark:** Yeah, we'll leave it at that.

**Ryan:** Okay.

**Mark:** The next question is from Flammel, We love you Flammel. 💚

### **Question:**

The temple, What is that? Do you guys want to talk about the temple? 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** I don't know if they have enough power level to set foot in the temple yet. It's a very holy place.

**Mark:** All right. We can't leak the Alpha just yet.

**Tyler:** I think we should not leak too much about the temple because we don't have it fully architected and planned out yet.

**Mark:** Let's put it this way. 

Temple is a very safe place for your NFTs and all your NFT information. It's not like a safe. But it is where you will meditate with your NFTs. You go to the temple, and they will show you the way through the Metaverse.

**Ryan:** A nonfungible sanctuary, if you will.

**Tyler:** Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

### **Question:**

Has the team reached out to any Crypto NFT media outlets to do interviews leading to and around the Marketplace Launch? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** No, we don't reach out to any crypto media places. They reach out. We just got featured in Fortune Magazine last week about the Lobby Lobsters. And honestly, I have a few journalists who have been reaching out and want to do some articles about the Universe Marketplace as we launched. We will also be posting our own articles. There will be articles from Medium and outlets. We are going to be doing more AMAs, I've been talking with Rugema at Shillr, and he was telling me that he wants us to start doing more Twitter spaces with other communities. So we'll start joining those, and the team will start joining those. We'll start figuring out more of that kind of date. So definitely, more marketing is coming. Part of the reason why you haven't seen marketing is because we haven't had stuff to market. We had the Polymorphs. But it's like we've been trying to build this marketplace and get all features. So now that we start rolling these out, we have a ton of stuff that we can roll out.

We even have videos documentation on all the products and features that we're going to release. So we have a lot coming on the marketing side. We have connections with some bigger brands, so we'll work on that. Don't worry about that. 

### **Question:**

Let's talk Pepes. Did we ever hear back from Fury? 🐸

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Tyler? I think that's a direct question for you.

**Tyler:** He responded with Shield & Pepe, but he didn't respond to anything other than that. So I don't know.

 ### **Question:**

Will Polymorphs be able to use ASM brains, and do Polymorphs and goblin times have a connection? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think simply the answer to these questions is yes, we have a plan for the Polymorph, and we will be releasing that plan soon. And yes, the Polymorphs will be able to have ASM brains. And yes, the Polymorphs are going to be headed to Goblin Town. 

Okay, next question.

**Ryan:** The polymorphs are lindy.

**Mark:** What?

**Ryan:** I think we've been around long enough where we can say that now.

**Mark:** Nice.

**Ryan:** We have staying power because we are iconic on Goblin Town even to leak Goblin Town.

**Nick:** Nobody knows anything. So if anyone tells you about Goblin Town, they're lying.

**Ryan:** If I tell you about Goblin Town, I'm lying because...

**Nick:** His sources. They made it up because nobody knows except for Aaron and Tyler. They're not going to tell you stuff because I already tried.

**Mark:** What's the source? Nick made it up.

**Trevor:** So, all you need to know about Goblin Town is that all of you know nothing.

**Ryan:** All I know— Is that I know nothing. I like it.

### **Question:**

When in the FLUF Discord, thousands of people see that we're partnering with FLUF World, how can we best explain to the average Joe in the FLUF Discord? 

First off, what is XYZ? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** This is a three-part question. I can answer this. 

Essentially, XYZ is your token to a community-curated marketplace. It's the gateway to what everyone has been asking for the last 6 months, a community-led project that the community controls. We are going to see features get pushed out by the community, and it's also an open-source protocol that anyone can use. And I think that's the powerful thing. And really, maybe the biggest differentiator of us from an OpenSea or some of these other protocols. Or actually, I wouldn't even call them protocols because we are a protocol. And that's what we're going to be as an NFT protocol where you can list these NFTs, and they're going to be listed on the protocol, not just some front-end on OpenSea. I don't know. It's hard to answer what XYZ is if someone else wants to take a crack at it.

**Ryan:** I like the second question he asks. 

### **Question:**

How does XYZ directly benefit FLUF World? 

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** I know most people holding FLUFs are not big fans of those selling FLUFs, but we all know that we need to sell our FLUFs here and there when the time is right and the personal circumstances line up. In those cases, it would make much more sense to list your FLUF on XYZ Universe Marketplace than it would over on OpenSea or anywhere else. And that's ultimately what we're going for, not just for the FLUFs but across the board. So I think it directly benefits FLUFs in the same way it benefits everybody else with lower fees, priority at the top of the aggregators, and a smooth, comfy nonfungible trading experience.

**Mark:** Chuba and Tyler probably could answer best. Well, I think I can answer this too. 

### **Question:**

So how will we truly take a share of the entire NFT marketplace volume going forward? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** The bottom line is, how can we strategically make ourselves a great partnership where we all belong together? Realistically, we go with that approach. 

If the artists and teams building these projects believe that XYZ is community-run like it is, then we are genuinely convinced that that's what the incentivization is. Honestly, it also tangles into something that we talked about earlier. We haven't necessarily come up with any plans to incentivize people other than we built this marketplace that essentially is what people have been asking for. An auction house with zero fees will go to their work there. A marketplace that takes a much smaller fee than OpenSea that's going to get people listing there. There are other ways to incentivize people than just giving them free stuff and airdropping. We understand what people want that kind of stuff. 

But what does the Apple iPhone do every year? 📱

Do you know what I mean? I think that like there are other ways to incentivize in this LooksRare model where there are people who just bond. I can't even explain it. I don't know. Maybe someone else wants to try and chime in here. 

**Ryan:** I mean, Tyler and I have been talking about a concept he brought up recently, the Pareto Distribution. It states that the top 20% has 80% of the impact. This is true across the board, whether it's in Ant colonies or in the top 20% of workers at a company doing 80% of the work or anything like that. So I can't leak any more alpha than Tyler will let me share. And I'm not sure what I'm allowed to leak here, but I think that thinking about the top 20% and focusing specifically on them is a very critical decision that we could make.

**Mark:** Tyler, do you have anything to add? We tried to build a marketplace.

**Tyler:** No, but I got to hop everybody.

**Ryan:** Okay.

**Ryan:** We got a good question here, Mark, if we're ready to move on to the next one.

**Greg:** Yeah, I just want to say Shout Out to Lobby Lobsters. Shout out Universe. You all are the greatest. And that's it. Shout out Chad and Shout Out Zach. Both Degens and yeah. I'm not too big of a tech guy, but I own a Lobby Lobster, and I love it, what it stands for, and what you're are doing. And that's all I got to say.

**Ryan:** The Lobby Lobsters love you too.

**Mark:** Thank you, Gbergphoto.

**Ryan:** So the next question is.

### **Question:**

Will there be some form of DAO presence to adjust the listing fees in the future? 

For example, a 5% royalty fee. We open a vote on the snapshot for XYZ holders, and if the quorum is reached, we adjust the fee?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** So currently, the marketplace fee is a DAO configurable parameter. What does that mean? It means that a DAO vote on-chain through Universe governance is required to adjust that number. 

It means that neither I, Mark, or anyone can go and single-handedly decide to charge fees on you guys. It also means that a snapshot vote is not sufficient to change the fees at the protocol level. This would look like we would have a signal, form proposal where someone would bring up the fact that this current set fee is not what we want. Maybe they want to argue for lower fees. Maybe they want to argue for higher fees. The community would have a discussion surrounding this. And once there's a little bit of consensus and a coherent approach, it would go into the next stage, the hot, cold, hot, warm test, which is done through a snapshot.

And this is done this way because its gasless voting. So there's no cost to get everyone signalling. Once a snapshot has passed the hot, cold test, it's kind of ready to be introduced into the on-chain governance phase, at which point it'll either be submitted for a proposal on its own or bundled with a bunch of other proposals that have also passed these hot, warm tests. And at that point, if that on-chain vote meets quorum and passes now, the royalty is adjusted. 

I think, kind of covers from start to finish what that governance process will look like. And very specifically applied to this example that is already kind of built-in this way so that it can play out exactly as I described. 

Who can I give private feedback to regarding this call? You can give feedback to myself or Mark. You can send anyone with a green name a friend request, and we'll be happy to respond in a DM if you want to keep it off the general channels.

**Mark:** Which question are we on? Because I had to walk away for a second.

**Ryan:** No worries. I was just covering the governance process a little bit, and I told Ben Franklin where he could go to give us some private feedback.

**Mark:** Okay, cool. Thank you. Ben Franklin. Did we answer this question about the success of the Polymorph and FLUFs?

**Ryan:** Yeah, I answered that.

**Mark:** Okay.

**Ryan:** We like the FLUFs.

### **Question:**

Will the polymorph join the burrows? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Yes, they will. We've been working on art for the burrows for 2-3th ree months. We have full-on 3D super high-res Polymorphs. We have all sorts of different Pixel art.

**Ryan:** It's high-resolution Pixel art.

**Mark:** Okay, so everyone knows, technically, when you go into FLUF Burrows, the rendering is low, so they're not going to have the super high quality.

Eventually, I think they're going to get to that point, but sometimes I think this goes to video games. Maybe Nick can explain this better, but when you play, you go super low res, your frames per second faster, the stuff doesn't glitch as much. But when you go super high res, you can glitch, but you'll get a better picture. But your frames per second suck. Sort of. I don't want to speak on behalf of the FLUF World.

**Ryan:** I know they can handle them on day one, and we'll improve them to be as high quality as they can continue to support. They will still look good because I imagine they will have lighting, special rendering, and some cool stuff that we have not seen in the NFT space. So I think, however it plays out, it will look beautiful. As beautiful as a polymorph can look after all.

**Mark:** Okay. I guess. Did we answer this question about the Airdrop page? 

We haven't updated it into the front-end yet. It's coming. 

### **Question:**

Do morphs get goblin whitelist? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We have no idea about any of that kind of stuff.

**Nick:** What is Goblin Town? We scroll down for like ten minutes. In this Pre AMA, it's just Goblin Town. Goblin Town, Goblin Town. Every question.

**Mark:** We're thinking about something to do for those nice people. We're going to figure it out. But yeah, the cut-off was at 100, so we'll figure it out because I think we're indifferent to those people. You might want to give them something cool like they missed out. All right.

**Mark:** Okay. I don't see any more questions other than if we'll be able to ride on a hoverboard.

### **Question:**

How long is the XYZ airdrop or how many tokens they'll have at the end of the XYZ Airdrop?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** I can quickly run down the fact that we cannot tell you how many tokens you'll have at the end because it's dependent entirely on how many people claim their Airdrop first. 

Our Airdrop channel will probably bully you if you claim early. But you will also have XYZ tokens. So that decision we leave up to the individual as we like freedom. But I know that most of our community members have not claimed. In fact, like, what is it? A hundred out of 1700 roughly have claimed. So you can use that trajectory to maybe come up with some models of how many tokens you'll have at the end. But nobody can give you a deterministic answer there.

**Mark:** Cosmo Kramer thinks we skipped over his questions. Can you talk a bit of the ERC consumables and how you're going to be able to rent out NFTs on Landworks?

**Ryan:** Sorry, can you repeat that? Cut out a little bit?

**Mark:** Can we tell Cosmo Kramer a little bit? He's asking. Hold on. Wait. I just lost it.

**Ryan:** Can you reply to the question, and I'll try to read it and answer it? What am I searching for?

**Mark:** Yeah, I just did it. I said yes.

### **Question:**

Is it possible that we would see products from Enter DAO integrated into the Universe NFT Marketplace talking about Landworks and Metaportal could bring more usability to the platform and let users use all those products more efficiently on one join platform? 

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** I can't confirm that this is a plan in the works, but I have a little bit of insight into how Land Works and Metaportal are being built. They're both permissionless systems that can be hooked into. If the community were in favour of us integrating these products directly into the Universe Marketplace, nothing would stop us from doing so. I could see a huge benefit of doing something like that, especially as these services become more and more desired by the people using them. Especially if Land prices were to skyrocket and you want to run venues and shows and do other things. I know many projects like having a set of land just for a week to run a giveaway or to do whatever kind of community-building exercise they're doing, and this becomes more and more difficult as the prices of these things go up.

So I can see a huge benefit to Landworks and Metaportal being included as a part of our front-end. But I also can't say that that's currently in the plan, but I can say if you all want it to be, it could be.

**Mark:** Yeah, we can do anything the community wants. That's the whole point of a DAO. Okay, Atari goddamedici is right. The first rule of Goblin. Talk about Goblin. Let's get this final word. Okay. Thank you, Chuba, for answering that question. 

**Ryan:** Of course. 

**Mark:** Troy are you still here?

**Troy:** Yes, I'm here.

**Mark:** Okay. Resistance has a question directed at you if you want to read it out or answer it, but it's at the bottom of the Pre AMA chat.

**Troy:** Yeah, I see it. Hold on. Let me think.

**Mark:** It's kind of long. So you can take a minute. Yeah, it's kind of long. I mean, dude, we're not lawyers.

### **Question:**

Hello Troy. I'm following your talks about legal issues with paying fees to the stakeholders. What if there will be a governance vote in the future to share some protocol revenue with stakeholders and DAO participants? I kind of thought that this was the end goal of every DAO. If I'm correct Uniswap should also share revenue with UNI holders in the future. I thought this is the whole point of holding governance tokens. To have vote in the governance and share on the revenue... Now from what you are saying it looks like this is not legally possible? 

### **Answer:**

**Troy:** Oh, wait. Yeah. So I think that is probably what many people are hoping for. Resistance is that we do get to a place like that. From what I've heard talking with other lawyers and people in the spaces, being behind the scenes, there's a pretty big push to get some sort of open. I think it's called open harbour laws in America to allow for these types of token mechanics to be allowed to operate because there are a lot of very powerful entities that want to see something like this happen, so it's not that safe harbour. 

The powerful entities want to see this happen. It's just a matter of getting the laws and everything set in place. I usually describe this is what happened back in the 90s during the first Internet wave, where you were not allowed to transact on the Internet with credit cards. They had to go and get congressional approval. They had to get a lock like a giant binding agreement passed through Congress that allowed for this. As soon as that happened, that's when you saw the floodgates open for the early Internet.

So you got places like Amazon. Amazon is the most obvious. But then you had Pets.com, things like this. So as soon as they did that, it really kind of created this new market that occurred. And that's the Internet we know today. But that wasn't always the way it was. There was huge pushback against allowing people to do credit card transactions over the internet. And so now you have that same kind of energy and force in Web 3 that's going on. And so, I'm optimistic that we will get to that point where there will be this moment where the switch can be flipped on. But we are not there yet. So we have to play by the rules that we know, and some legal counsel advises us on what to do. If the DAO chooses to do something like this and people voted in, there isn't much like the people here who can do about it. Right. That is the other side of the sword.

**Ryan:** I don't want to live like an instruction manual on what not to do to make this happen. But ultimately, we're a DAO. And that means that everything is up for a vote. Anyone can write a contract that does whatever they want that contract to do and vote to send those funds to that contract and execute that in whatever way they see fit. And if the DAO agrees to do it, there's nothing any of us can do to stop it. Again, I'm not trying to write the instruction manual on what not to do to help you make it happen. 

But it is to say that it is a real DAO. That means that just like any other real DAO, there is no founder control or way of blocking any of these things from happening in that these tokens are out there. People can buy tokens and use those to vote. We can do our best to stay compliant and ensure that the proposals we write do not violate any laws. But we have no control over what anyone else is going to propose or do or how they vote.

**Mark:** Yeah, I have a question about that. The whole credit card thing because that's probably before my time, is that kind of like reverse to what we're talking about, how with NFTs, even if you had a legal document about the NFT, the court might not accept it?

**Troy:** That comes down to what the government will recognize as a legal document. 

I don't know what happened with GitHub and when they started putting licenses in there, that's a different conversation. I do remember because I was like twelve or maybe even younger. (11)

I remember when the credit card approval was passed because it was everywhere. And then, all of a sudden, you have this explosion of dotcom companies, and it was a free for all. So people think if we ever see something like that in crypto, we haven't seen anything yet. You truly are early because these are global ecosystems that allow people to transact around the entire world. And so originally, a lot of that stuff was based in America, but now the Internet is everywhere. That would be a wild situation, and I'm here for it if we get there.

### **Question:**

His question was regarding Rarible, they are no fees, but they have cashback in Rarible, could this also be a legal issue?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** We're not sure.

**Troy:** I'd have to go and look at exactly how that works, and I don't know what that completely means— cashback.

**Algy:** Yeah. We don't know how we're able exactly how that is set up. So basically, the short answer is we don't know. But it would be very surprising to me if Rarible's Team didn't communicate with lawyers about their decisions. Let's just say because that's what everybody should be doing.

**Troy:** I'd be surprised by that too, just because of the people involved there.

**Mark:** Yeah. They can afford the lawyers.

**Troy:** Let me put it this way; I will go and talk to lawyers about this for you. 

Okay. I will write up an email if you can send me exactly how this works. If you send me an email about that or send me a message, I will do it, and I will reach out to our people.

**Mark:** Nice.

**Troy:** I'm curious, too. 🤔

**Mark:** I mean, this is something that we have talked about, part of why we're so nervous about it, don't. So we're just all right, but we see other people.

**Troy:** But for everyone to understand our number one North Star for the past probably 3 months. Well, since the beginning. But for the past 3 months, we have been dead set on getting this thing done, getting everything off of dependencies that all other marketplaces are using. It's not that we don't want to look at this and the tokenomics and everything. Still, the overhead of getting this tech done was much greater than any of us when we first started to do this, which was a year ago when Tyler and Tim were sitting in hotels talking about what we could do. After Pepe? Let's do a marketplace. And it was a much bigger scope than any of us realized what we were getting into. And we became laser-focused. And this is what we want to get done, and this is what we want to get out. And all these conversations are great, and I want to have them. But the most important thing is getting this thing out first, and then we can figure out this other stuff because it's a DAO it's upgradable. We can change it. It's not set in stone. And all of you having the voice in here is what's most important because we're here for it.

**Ryan:** The treasury isn't going anywhere, and it's not going to grow without a marketplace. We're going to focus on getting that out. And then I think as these conversations start to get wrapped up, especially over the next couple of weeks, we'll be able to have better answers on how this will look. And we'll be able to answer without falling back on this shield of like; we're not sure about the legality because, ultimately, no one can be 100% certain. 

But as long as we ship this marketplace, the treasury will accrue the marketplace fees. It'll be up to the DAO and the community exactly how we do that. And I think Troy is saying he's going to look into it as much as he can, but we can't give you everything right now. And I think that's okay.

**Algy:** I was trying to say that part of this question talks about how they airdrop their tokens to people. And I'm going to drop a link to this form that we have going on about this topic, and you guys can check it out and participate there. I'm going to share it in Pre AMA. So take a look at that chat right now. There it is.

**Ryan:** Algy is trying to say that I think we've all been here for almost an hour and a half now. I'm not seeing too many questions rolling through. So take it to the forums, people.

**Troy:** Thanks, everyone. I have to roll! ✌️

**Mark:** Our existing airdrops are already determined, but if you are interested in airdrops, join this forum discussion; https://forum.universe.xyz/t/airdrop-to-opensea-users-web3-discussion-and-proposal/73/72

Aly just posted and put your input in. And we're all part of this. We're going to discuss it. If we think that this is, we're going to put this into a DAO vote. So thank you, everybody, for joining.

**Algy:** Thank you, everybody, for the question somebody asked about POAPS for these AMAs.

**Mark:** If you guys want POAPs for joining these community AMAs, that's something that we can work on. 

Also, I would like to say a few more things. We're sponsoring an event. Our partner's articles were hosting the opening event at ETH Denver, so we will be sponsoring that event. A lot of the if anyone's out at in 2 weeks, 3 weeks, I think it is it's like November, or I'm sorry, I believe it's February 16 or 17th of the party is the opening event on the weekend because during the week like a half weekend type things. Yeah, that's something we're going to do, and then I think it's like a pretty big deal they're going to have open panels. 

We're going to do and try to post that online, but it's going to be like a universe panel all where I believe me, Ryan, Tim will speak. We will talk about our mission and what we want to accomplish. Some of those questions that lucky Luke was asking like, What is XYZ? And we'll try to get that recorded and then post that.


**Everyone:** ✌️✌️✌️✌️
