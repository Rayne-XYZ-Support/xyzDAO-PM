## Intro

**Mark:** We accidentally had a miscommunication last week, and some people did not hop on the previous Wednesday morning call so we didn't have a project call. We will make up for that in the coming weeks and wanted to be transparent with everybody. We're sorry about that. We will go ahead and give some development updates from last week. 

I will hand it off to Ryan. 

## Development Updates üß∞ [[00:45]](https://youtu.be/kp0dW0KVjYQ?t=45)

**Ryan:** Outside of UI improvements that tie together the on hovers and the different things you can do on the site. The big things we've been focused on are both the order creation and purchasing of the order. Specifically, to add ERC 1155 support, we're adding support so that you can see all your 1155s on the Universe Marketplace my NFTs page. From there, you will be able to list those NFTs for sale on the market. Along with choosing a royalty split with up to five wallets. So when you list an NFT for sale or create a bid, you will be able to define five different addresses that could receive a portion of that sale. On the other side, it opens up a whole bunch of integrations that would allow other marketplaces and a whole host of additional content to plug right into Universe and receive an incentive for leading users over to our platform. Then to touch more on the 1155 support, the big thing there is you will be able to list as many NFTs in your wallet to sell that token ID. So you don't have to go and sign 100 messages or anything to list 100, 1155s for sale.

You can list all 100 of those at once, then somebody could buy them in chunks, or they could buy the whole lot. It's a feature I'm excited about, and we've been pushing hard to support those partial fills and the entire 1155 set up there. That covers the major things that we've been working on. There are many other things, including the massive database migration underway.

I don't want to talk too much about the benefits of this. Still, it opens us up to do many things that will speed up the marketplace, both in terms of browsing the site and with others who plug into it like Genie and Gem and integrate with us as best as possible.

**Mark:** It will optimize the whole site together. There are many things that the database migration is going to help with. That has been quite a lift, and we're closer to pushing that out.

**Ryan:** Outside of the speed, I think Mark is hinting that this database migration allows us to open up a whole host of new trade filtering supports and aggregated queries and technobabble. It will enable us to tie all the data on the site together and give you all the best features. 

I can hand it over to Zach to provide some updates on the Polymorphs.

## Polymorphs ü§° [[03:45]](https://youtu.be/kp0dW0KVjYQ?t=225)

**Zach:** I've been busy making sure that the Polymorphs are continuing to be dope. We've been working with animators and comedians, and you may have to piece together the alpha from other calls. But we're bringing the Polymorph Characters to life in an entertaining and unique way. It will help give holders something to look forward to as far as seeing their precious little Polymorphs be involved in some real-life situations. That's all I'm going to say about that part. The only reason I'm being short is that I want it to be a surprise. Besides that, I've been talking about burn to mint. We're finally coming in on the final stages of getting that work through. In the next couple of weeks, we'll have a cool initiative to get everybody to migrate to this new contract that allows for more functionality with your Polymorphs. 

Burning your Polymorph will give you a claim pass for the Polymorphic Faces, and you will be able to claim for free on a 1-to-1 basis a Polymorphic Face, which will have the same scrambled technology. You will be able to come up with some fantastic combinations that might involve some game theory. That's all I can talk about on the Polymorph side right now. 

**Mark:** If you know anything about us, we like game theory. We like putting the choice in the community's hands of what you do with your Polymorphs. There are a lot of ideas and speculation once we release this info. We want to be clear about people buying the Polymorphs with the intent of knowing they would be able to be scrambled. We did have to turn that off. If you ever want to do that again, you will have to migrate to the new contracts. 

If everyone migrates, what does that say to the Polymorphs that stay on the original contract? I don't know. I think that's part of the game theory, and we'll see what happens. üëÄ

**Zach:** You will have time to migrate. It's not going to close in any set amount of time. In the contract, I made sure we built in the ability for the DAO vote to close the burn to mint, which also would mean closing the eligibility for claiming your faces. The scrambling mechanics are also slightly modified, and I'm not going to go into that, but we're ramping up the game theory on Polymorphs.

**Mark:** As of right now, the plan is to leave that mint open until the DAO decides otherwise. We are adding that function to be able to shut down this migration at some point. But only the DAO vote can call that function.

**Zach:** That's about it on the Polymorph side of things. 

## Community Questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è [[08:30]](https://youtu.be/kp0dW0KVjYQ?t=510)

**Zach:** We can head into the questions on this forum. I only saw one. If anybody has questions in the audience right now, go ahead, and you can drop them in the PreAMA or head to that Forum Link. 

**Mark:** What's easiest for everyone is, once the call starts, definitely the Pre-ama chat. A forum is an excellent place for pre-questions, but it's easier than having to refresh the page every 5 seconds.


### **Question:** ‚ùì

Is it possible to find the road map somewhere? Would it be possible to make it public so we know what the current progress is? The white label solution that can be used to connect to Universe?

### **Answer:**

**Zach:** I think we dropped some alpha in the past AMAs. üòâ

**Mark:** But the best way to answer this is probably not. We have an internal roadmap for development, building and making progress. We have been trying to build a roadmap that can explain how we're going through this process. We're making these development sprints in one and two weeks and pushing things live as soon as we're done. Then everything gets pushed together in these sprints. We haven't done weekly updates because this sprint wasn't a weekly sprint. The two-week sprint got blocked and turned into a three-week sprint. We can announce what we have finished and our current priorities, and we will give those updates every week or every two weeks. 

We are building this massive tool and talked about building this last year, which we've made progress on, but it's not the current priority. But many of those things still in our original white paper are things that we want to accomplish, and we're still going to stick to our guns and what we originally set out to do. But we hear the community about the roadmap. It's not the easiest thing to be this is exactly when this is coming because of how this process has been so far.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

When is one of one takeover?

### **Answer:** ‚ùì

**Zach:** It's already begun.

**Mark:** With a lot of these, we're seeing it. One of the one-pieces is starting to take the spotlight in the NFT space. Where we're seeing PFP projects, we have all seen what happened with the Azuki. It's not the best look for PFP team-run projects. Some people are now taking more favouritism to one of one artist where they can support the artist and trust the artist versus this anonymous team. These people care about their art and put their heart and soul into it. Zach, would you add anything to that? You're an artist and a photographer. Photography is still one of them. I don't think anyone can take two of the same photos.

**Zach:** In reality, being a successful artist is the same as in the Web3 NFT space and is the same as being a successful artist in general. You have to build an audience that cares about your work, which takes years and years. 

 It's like dropping pieces that have to be finished within the day or only have an hour, and it sucks, but it's going to be put out anyways because he made something. That's what I like about one of one artist, but it takes time. People come into the NFT space and see all these artists pulling in 10 ETH off a piece. You need to build an audience first, regardless of if you're selling a physical print or an NFT.

**Mark:** I think that's a real opportunity here at Web3 that artists see is, I don't have to have my studio in St. Petersburg, Florida, and I hope everyone will come in and see this on the corner. I now have a medium NFT that I can put on the Internet and anyone can see on OpenSea. 

**Zach:** Crypto does, in general, for everything, whether it be DeFi or lowering the barrier to entry for tools that regular people typically don't have in the traditional system. It costs a lot of money to make a huge three-foot-wide archival print that gets hung in a museum. That costs more money to complete than minting and deploying an NFT contract. So it does lower the barrier of entry, which is great. It's very similar to being successful in the traditional art world.

**Mark:** I like how you're talking about comparing the canvas and the supplies to the mint price and how it's cheaper. Think about how many times someone has drawn on a piece of paper, crumbled it up, and thrown it away. Creating digital art gives you the ability not to destroy that medium or have to pay $35 for a canvas where you could potentially screw up. You can create this art and then say this üí© is finished. Now I have this one-time cost to mint that I don't have to do a trial run and say this isn't exactly what I had envisioned or pictured. 

**Zach:** Once more services are helping artists develop their ideas on top of Ethereum, we will see more prestigious one-to-one artists move over. Artists disagree with entities right now, but eventually, they'll realize that it's a great way to prove the authenticity of a physical piece. 

## Proposal: PID #8 üèõ [[19:08]](https://youtu.be/kp0dW0KVjYQ?t=1148)

**Zach:** Maybe it's a good time to bring up that we have a proposal in the warm-up phase, so be on the lookout for that. We have 18 more hours in the warm-up.

**Mark:** Do you want to go over some of what's in that proposal and what we're voting on?

**Zach:** This PID #8 deals with branding, outreach and some marketplace upgrades. So we're proposing to reduce the on-chain marketplace fees from 1.69 to 1%. We had a pretty extensive discussion on the forum about that. Most of us agree that it's a good idea to bring that fee down with the things that we plan to do in the future with the marketplace. Also, adding payment tokens. This is a good initiative to bring other communities in and have things come full circle back to Universe. 

Included tokens: 
* APE
* ASTO
* BOND
* AAVE
* LEAG
* SAND
* MANA
* SYLO
* AXIE
* ASH
* ENTR
* ILV
* LINK
* FDT
* SNX 

We'll start with those. Then if anybody in the future wants to see more tokens available for use on the marketplace, we can have another form of discussion about that and get it pushed into the proposal. Then the last thing is transferring 100K worth of ETH to Monstercat for NFT-NYC.

I had a call last week with Monstercat, and we're doing some cool branding initiative things at the event itself. I will continue working with them to get some Polymorphs to showcase at other events that Monstercat is partnering with. At this NFT-NYC event, I gave them a pretty big folder of assets to use. It's a music DJ event with a bunch of art on a huge screen behind the DJ. So we're going to see some Charles on there. We're waiting on confirmation from the venue, but we'll have a bunch of Polymorph custom cups. So everybody that gets a drink at this venue will have a naked Charles on their cup. If they don't let us do that, we will do cocktail napkins. My main goal with this is to get the Universe Branding as elevated as possible and not just on the Polymorph side but also the Universe XYZ Branding. 

It's the same deal as last time we did this. If you pull up to NYC for this, I believe it's at Webster Hall on the 19th of June. 

If you got a Lobster or Polymorph, you get in for free. If you don't have a Lobster or Polymorph and you're in this chat and in NYC üóΩ, shoot me a DM and tell me why you want to come to this event üéä; I'm sure I can help you get in.

**Mark:** Last year when we did NFT-NYC, we had a ticket claim through ticket ferry. It's going to be Monstercat's decision on how that is handled. It's not going to be like you show your Polymorph at the door and get in. Last year you had to claim with your wallet, connect through ticket ferry, and get a free ticket, and they emailed it to you, and then your email was how you get in.

The venue has a limited amount of people. The venue holds, I want to say 2200-2500 people, maybe less. Not every Polymorph holder is going to be able to go. That's why the RSVP is important. That's why we also open it up to the Lobby Lobsters.

**Zach:** They're going to be documenting this party. I've already expressed concerns to Monstercat, Universe communities about handing over or donating that money for this activation. I'm pushing to make sure that everything that comes out about this event after, whether the YouTube videos or just the branding, has the Universe branding involved. We should get some good looks from it.

**Mark:** From a brand perspective, last year, partnering with Monstercat and doing that party was good and was great for the brand. Sponsoring these events is important in getting Universe out there. We meet many people here, and people want to come and enjoy these parties, and you meet builders. Brooklyn is one of the biggest Crypto hubs in the world, and these are great events for exposure to the brand, and people get to learn about new things. That's why we target NFT-NYC for these events.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What is the payment structure for partners? How do the fees work?

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** The partners will be able to choose their fee structure. We won't have any control over that. So a partner can go and set up a 5% fee or a 10% fee when orders are created from their market. Those orders are made from their market, and their users will have to agree to whatever fee that market sets up. They can't go and charge egregious fees. The payment structure is flexible in those white label partner hands. The same is true on the bid side as well that any bids created on that platform will be able to be purchased on Universe or filled on Universe and will pay out to that white-label marketplace. A whole lot of flexibility for anybody who wants to integrate the payment splits. Do we have any more questions, or does anyone in the audience want to raise their hand and come up and ask a question?

**Mark:** We're working on bringing the Polymorphs to all the metaverses. We've been working on that for quite a while now, approaching game time. We're going to be able to play with our Polymorphs. We've been trying not to leak any of that.

**Zach:** It's an unreal playground. Polymorphs are fully functional in-game engines.

**Mark:** They are already looking good. We're just going to optimize them more because you build those rigs, and they look good. Then the more speed, motion and random shit you add on, and the more we optimize some of the 3D models, they start to look after many reworking.

**Zach:** We have high poly versions, which are the versions that I use when I make that silly Polymorph renders. Then we have mid poly versions that can be used in certain game engines. Then we're building super low poly versions that will have baked materials, so they still look good, but less capable engines can handle them.

**Mark:** We appreciate everyone for coming in and joining our AMA. If you guys have any questions that did not get answered on this AMA, we will post a forum today or tomorrow to get some questions coming in for the next AMA. Then you are free to post on the PreAMA channel all week. 

**Zach:** Can you not share your screen in stages? 

**Ryan:** Sadly not.

No screen sharing and no video-sharing. That's the one drawback. 

**Zach:** That's all right. I'll hold the alpha then.

**Ryan:** Alpha leaks for another day. No leaky ship. Well, not too leaky. ‚õµÔ∏èüíß

Thanks, everyone. See you next week.

**Zach:** Later everybody. ‚úåÔ∏è
