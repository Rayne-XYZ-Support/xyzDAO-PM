## Intro [[00:00]]()

**Mark:** Hey, everyone! Welcome to Universe xyzDAO project call 12!

We had a big week last week! With the Lobby Lobsters drop. I'll let Tyler dive in and talk about that. 

Thank you, everyone, for participating in that. 🙌 🎉

## Lobby Lobsters  🦞🦞 [[00:19]](https://youtu.be/N9XX4RF8N64?t=19)

**Tyler:** Yeah, it was a huge success. I did not realize– from the lobbying perspective– how much money we donated towards crypto efforts. It is clearly coming at the right time, with regulators trying to learn what is happening with crypto and what they can do.

### 1000 ETH to [Coincenter](https://www.coincenter.org/)

There is currently a DAO vote up to donate the ETH to [Coincenter](https://twitter.com/coincenter). If you look at the DAO vote, it explains who they are. [Neeraj](https://twitter.com/neerajka) has been in the space for a very long time. Anyone who is an OG crypto person has seen him around crypto Twitter discussing lobbying efforts. 

He works with an organization called Coincenter. He said this is essentially four times their annual budget. Maybe a lot of crypto people have specific lobby groups that they work with. So, I won't carpet the entire industry with a statement. However, not referring to any individuals, I think that is somewhat pathetic. 

If you are in crypto, I recommend (If you missed the drop) getting Lobby Lobsters to support lobbying efforts in DC. Several people have asked why it is for America. We are all Americans, but it's ultimately a world superpower whether you want to argue that or not. They have a massive reach globally. 

Ultimately we need to get America on our side for crypto. China is another massive superpower, and if people in China want to do the same thing. I know nothing about the Chinese government and how to go about that. I can't help. 

We are Americans. So, we see it as a place that we can start and drive the most impact. The largest in crypto for American interests in DC can now multiply their initial budget by four times. At a pivotal time when we need it the most. As far as that goes, I think the project was a massive success.

We were talking before we got on this call. We need to work on marketing and letting people in our ecosystem know that the ongoing sales go towards lobbying. You didn't miss the drop necessarily. We are working on additional things to build with the Lobsters. 

Obviously, we are extremely busy with a lot of what we will talk about on this call. The Polymorphs game, auctions, minting, and the marketplace is coming together. This started as a tweet thread from industry leaders a few weeks ago, and we worked tirelessly to get this done and launched.  

There is still a ton of other stuff that we need to focus on. But, I think this was absolutely successful enough that we can continue to work off the momentum & timing that is in place.

**TLDR;**

We need time to work through all the details. But, if we did this correctly, and Lobby Lobsters continues to be a long-term success. Not a flash in the pan. I think we can drive this long-term. Enacting real change for the ecosystem. It naturally helps America– which in turn helps the rest of the world. Even if that sounds egotistical as an American. It's a fact of the matter and how the world works at the present time.

This was a huge success. It goes to an exceptional cause. It helps all of us and anyone watching this that owns an NFT. Even if you are not super deep in the industry. I don't think people realize how much change and help this will bring. It is a massive win in my head. I think everyone on this call wants to ensure it continues to be a massive success.  

**Troy:** I think it is important for people to understand that it is continually ongoing. It's not over. If you want to keep contributing, that's possible. This was designed for perpetuity. All funds somehow make it toward lobbying efforts. (I forget the percentage)

It's nearly a badge of honour for your portfolio. Saying I'm supportive of this idea. As the price goes up, the more you support it. The more people that hold will cause the floor to rise.

**Tyler:** I tweeted about that, and so did [Gmoney](https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT)! At some point, people who do not have these in their wallets...I realize people are making a ton of money in this industry. This is why I say it is pathetic that Coincenter had only a million dollars up until Lobby Lobsters. 

There are people with fifty million dollars worth of NFTs in their wallets. But, they don't want to help lobbying efforts. And some of these people are Americans. 

Fifty million is a random number. I'm not speaking about one specific person. I threw that number out randomly– in case people try and look around and figure out who I'm talking about.

I believe this will become a badge of honour. It's almost like anti-grift. If you are making a ton of money on NFTs and don't care about helping the ecosystem. In my head, that is a grifter. 

**Troy:** Yeah, that is a grift!

**Mark:** A few other things about the Lobby Lobsters.

### Rarity Tools/Sniper

**Mark:** Several people in the community have been asking about Rarity Tools and Rarity Sniper. 

Hopefully, Rarity Sniper gets us up there within the next few days. We are good with them. Rarity Tools seems extremely backed up. We have tried reaching out to them before. I knew they were hard to get in touch with, and they finally got back to me yesterday. They told me they're completely slammed. So, we will eventually get on Rarity Tools.

But, it seems like they do not have the capacity to onboard us at this moment. Although, we are working on it. We are trying to get it listed there. A few other sites have listed our Rarities. Al posted one last night in the Discord. (He called it the unofficial rarity) 

**Al:** Technically, any of them will be an unofficial rarity. Because all of the math formulas they use (Even Rarity Tools) are opinion-based. There are always things that you can argue about because you think they should change.

The site that has a rarity tool for us is called [Nifty River](https://www.niftyriver.io).

[Link to Lobsters on Nifty River](https://www.niftyriver.io/rarity/0xc0cb81c1f89ab0873653f67eea42652f13cd8416)

**Mark:** Nifty River, right! Nice.

**Al:** I pinned a link to it in the Lobby Lobster Discord channel. (In general chat)

### Future of the Lobsters

**Mark:** More about the Lobsters. We are definitely thinking about ideas and things to do with them. We are not going to leave them alone. We have had a few people in our Discord accusing us of a variety of weird things. 

**Tyler:** I don't understand how people can get mad. We were very open. The entitlement of some people in crypto is beyond me. We were transparent about the fact the money was going to Coincenter. We did not keep the money. In fact, we said it was going towards lobbying efforts, and we did not specify Coincenter.

You can look at the DAO vote and go to Coincenters website to verify that the address that receives the funds is a credited lobbying group. They have done more for lobbying efforts in crypto than anyone else. If you bought it for any other reason than you like the art and want to support lobbying efforts in DC– in my head, f**k off! We will keep working on it because we want/like to. 

We did not keep the money or leave with it. It did not go to tylerwardswallet.com 🤦

If people have an issue with that, I don't know why. You did not read the text that we had on the website. We were clear about what we were doing and why. Plus, if you are not in it for the right reason, then sell your lobby lobster. Someone else will buy it, and they will join the movement. 

**Mark:** Exactly! 

**Troy:** And the blockchain will always know! 😂

**Mark:** Yes, remember, we will always know. 

**Tyler:** And we will know in Discord if you are a douchebag.

**Troy:** It's on the blockchain. Anyone who did that, your wallet is black-listed. 🤪😂

**Mark:** That would be funny! 😅

**Tyler:** I don't think there is anything wrong with selling a Lobby Lobster. But, I think coming into the Discord and suggesting that we are not doing something post-launch. That we were expected to do. We were clear, the art is cool, and the money went where we said it was to go.

What else do you want? For us to do something more than what we had initially said?

The money that you used went towards lobbying efforts in DC. If that is not why you bought it, I don't know what to tell you. That is a 'you' problem.

**Mark:** So, now that the Lobby Lobsters have been discussed. And thank you to everyone in the community. Even the haters, because you all motivate us. 

We could not have done this without you guys. We are all in this together. That 1000 ETH will definitely go towards helping and making a difference. Honestly, we should all be proud of this. It came at a perfect time. I'm already talking with Tyler about ways that we can try and help. 

If you are interested– Tyler and I get a ton of DMs. But, hit us up if you have ideas on how to help in your local area. The best thing you can do is get boots on the ground. Call your senator. You can make donations on your own to Coincenter. They have a public address on their website. As Tyler said, anyone can donate directly to that address. Nothing is stopping anyone from doing that. 

Perhaps it needs more awareness so that you know you can donate ETH to them. In my opinion, that is pretty cool. As Tyler said, there are people out there buying a 2000 ETH CryptoPunk. Some people can probably take  ETH out of cold storage and make an easy two-thousand dollar donation in ETH. 

**Tyler:** Some of those people live in China. They may not care about US efforts. 

**Mark:** That is true. I'm just saying if you think about the money being spent, It is sensible. 

**Tyler:**  I did watch some crypto influencers that I know are American– because I've been in spaces with them, and they have American accents. They were talking shit about Lobby Lobsters. So, that means they are not in it for the right reasons. Plus, if you are not active, the NFT ecosystem will not make it long term. 

Just as we are fighting in DeFi, they will come for NFTs next. There will be a lot of scrutiny about the things going on. If the NFT does not start getting active around the things happening in DC. You will be sadly disappointed when you see how much power those people truly have. 

Enjoy the Twitter spaces while you can or get active and ensure this is a long-term thing.  

**Mark:** This is serious. With elections coming up, this is the time where we can move and make a difference. If you want to make a difference. The best way to do it, call your Congressperson, Senators etc. 

Try to educate local public officials. Donate money to local lobbyist groups. Get involved. 

**Tyler:** Buy a Lobby Lobster and make it your profile picture. Start talking about them. 

We will keep building on top of this. It is important whether people realize that or not. We are not stopping here. 

**Mark:** I'm only saying. There are other ways to get involved as well. 

You can do it yourself. The entire 'Someone else will do it' mentality is not effective. We must all work together– we are all in this together whether we like it or not. 

We will move on to the Polymorphs now because I have a few updates for them. We have been talking about the Lobby Lobsters enough. (Everything got covered)


## Polymorphs 🧫🦹  [[15:31]](https://youtu.be/N9XX4RF8N64?t=931)

**Mark:** The Polymorph Battle Game is moving on to audits. It is looking finished and fun!

### Battle Game

We have seen the Polymorphs battle. I think everyone will be super excited when they can eventually battle each other. I don't think I have gone over too much about the game.  

It will be 1v1. You will either join a game fight a random Polymorph. Each has stats based on the items that they have. We have a few lists floating around in the Discord about Polymorph power scaling. It kind of shows how much power or damage they have. (I think it's attack and defence)

Either all the attributes go towards attack, or they go towards defence. They have a scalable range. For example, the Taekwondo pants are 150 attack. (It might be 150 attack & defence)

I'm not sure off the top of my head because I am not looking at it. The combination of all of these items adds up. You get a random number pulled from your range. That also happens on the other side. 

Whoever has the highest number– wins. 

Then it will simulate a battle, and you get to watch the Polymorphs fight. One of them will win, and the person will get the wagered ETH. That person can keep battling their Polymorph or leave because he is undefeated. I'm not sure how people will play this or game it. 

I'm thinking a lot of people will want to battle Polymorphs and go undefeated. I'm looking forward to how Juicetra's Polymorph does. Because he has the full Spartan. We have the David vs Goliath effect in this game. So, no one Polymorph will be too overpowered. Although, I think the ones with complete sets might have a slight advantage. So, that will be cool to see how it plays out. 

We are extremely excited about it. The developers have been playing around with it, and they have been having a ton of fun– we hope you will too!

### Polygon Bridge 

**Mark:** Our Polygon bridge and the other reasons we had frozen the scrambling for (Contract upgrades) are finished. We will line all of that up to get audited. 

Once that gets audited. And everything is good to go. We will turn the scrambling back on. So people can bridge their Polymorphs to Polygon, and people can scramble them for almost free. Scrambling will still cost money. I saw some people in the Discord mention that they thought something mentioned that we would get free scrambles.

We may have misworded what we said. We meant fee-less scrambles. Not free scrambles. If anyone was confused by that– we are sorry. You won't get to scramble your Polymorph for free, but it won't cost a gas fee like Ethereum. (After it gets bridged to Polygon)


So that's nearly finished, and we will have a proposal live soon to turn scrambling back on. Then everyone can resume that. We appreciate everyone for being patient and understanding in our reasonings.

We appreciate that everyone was cool about it. Even though it has taken about a month. It is all moving faster. It will get back on, and everyone can resume– the battle game will be live around the same time. I think everyone will have a lot of fun. Not to mention we have other games in the pipeline. 

The community knows about MorphLand. Which is our second game. The team is already working on a v2 version of the battle game. We won't stop building. As Tyler said, the people who think we won't build stuff or think we are done with the Lobby Lobsters. Just watch what we are doing with the Polymorphs. 

You can make a judgement on what you think we are doing. A lot is coming for Polymorph holders. Not to mention we have a party that we put a proposal in for in November. 


## XYZ NFT NYC 🍎🌃 [[20:44]](https://youtu.be/N9XX4RF8N64?t=1244)

**Troy:** This is Tim's initiative. But, I'll give a quick rundown. There is a proposal that has been put in. It was on Snapshot. It passed. 

We will put it into a DAO vote. 

It's a 400K payment for a party in New York in November. It says on the Snapshot– November 3rd, but I think it will happen on the 4th. 

Tim will be able to answer that. It's a world-class venue in NYC. Attendees of up to 2,200. Tim will be subsidizing the 400K. With 100K of his own money. There will be VIPs there. It will be a big party. 

The big deal for Universe token holders– mainly these bad boys behind me. The Polymorphs. You can use the Polymorphs to get into the venue. So, if you hold a Polymorph, then it's your ticket to the party. 

That's why we will be sponsoring the event. I don't think we have announced who it is with yet. We don't have legal clearance. But, trust me, it is going to be huge. 

We are all really excited about it. I believe it is November 4th. 

**Mark:** Yeah, I think we are doing the 4th because NFT NYC extended by a day. Tim wanted it to be the last night. He wanted a big sending-off. 

We will have a special guest, VIPs that are maybe not Polymorph holders, but everyone will know who they are. There will be live music. We are not announcing who will be performing. The community can make guesses. But, we are not revealing anything yet. 

I don't know if Troy announced it, but the venue is around 2,200 people. Right now, there are only 1,700 Polymorph holders. So, as of right now, every single Polymorph holder is definitely getting in or can get in. 

I want everyone to take note November 4th, NYC NFT is what we are doing. We will be there, and if you would like to come, you are all invited to the party. You guys can meet us. We will be having fun.

We want to do this for all of you. It will be a big thing. We are hoping that all of our products are launched, and we can make a grand reveal. Saying that we are Universe and we are here to stay! We want to be a part of this ecosystem. We are very excited about it. Hopefully, everyone can be there. If you would like your friend to go, there is still time to get Polymorphs. Do what you need to do.

## Auctions and Minting  [[24:14]](https://youtu.be/N9XX4RF8N64?t=1454) 🥼⚗️

**Mark:** I have a few more updates on auctions and minting audits. 

### Audits (Finalizing changes)

This is our third round of audits. They have come back, and it looks good. There were minor changes that we had to make. We sent those changes back, and hopefully, we have those audits completely finalized. Then we can publish. 

### Testing & Connecting

We are going ahead and connecting all the back end and getting our test environment finished. Then we are going to open up beta testing to some of our users in Discord. 

We have around 100 people called the Chosen Ones. They were discretionary people who helped us along– essentially over eight months. They were very early supporters. We're going to give those people beta testing access. They can use the app and find any edge cases or bugs. 

One big thing about developing sites and doing projects like this. When you stare at the same thing for months, it is easy to overlook small little things. Getting new eyes on it is one of the best things you can do. 

**Tyler:** It's called design and development tunnel vision. 

**Mark:** Yeah! It happens to me all the time. You get a new set of eyes on something, and they pull up a great point. Sometimes you need to make changes. It could be a quick front-end UI fix. Maybe a button is not working how it needs to. 

We just need some help with that, but we are right on the finish line for this. So, we will be really excited when we finally get this launched, and people can start minting NFTs on Universe. 

The marketplace is coming, but it's not going to be instant. When you mint an NFT on Universe, you can use our auctions for auctioning off the NFT. You will get 100% of the revenue from the initial sale from auctions. (It goes to you, the artist)

We take no fee from the initial auction. You can take an NFT you minted on Universe and sell it on any platform. You're subjected to the fees included on those websites. 

Just know, the minting platform that we are working towards is trying to be completely decentralized technology. We will continue to move toward ensuring NFTs are sufficiently decentralized– as the technology grows and gets better every month & year. 

I want everyone to know we won't be launching and then not delivering continuous updates. We are going to be building, adding new features, tools. The cool part about this being structured as a DAO– anyone who owns XYZ tokens can suggest a feature or make a suggestion about the website. We can spin up a proposal and build that. 

I believe that's a powerful way to do things. I've seen so many times– I don't mean to throw OpenSea under the bus, even Rarible is guilty– someone tweets about a feature and suggests something that gets buried in a tweet thread, and no one goes back to it.

Universe is a place where that tweet thread can exist, and we can go back to this. We can put a proposal in and add the feature. Because this conversation was great. Everyone in this industry has some form of ADHD, all the time we think– this is shiny over here, let's do this! Then we end up forgetting about a brilliant idea that someone had during a conversation. 

Props to Rarible, I've been checking a few times over the last few weeks, and they are making interface updates that the community asks for. Like a 'Buy Now' filter. I don't know how it took them so long to get that feature. But the community asked for it, and they didn't need a governance vote. Although, the fact they did it– the community asked months ago. And they finally did it! 

I see OpenSea saying that they don't know how decentralized companies are going to make decisions. Although, it doesn't seem like centralized companies are making decisions much faster. 

If someone in the community thinks it's powerful enough and it needs to get done. People can take it upon themselves to form a proposal and say that we need to build this feature at once. The community can agree or disagree about it. If no one has had that realization yet– I know we talk about it sometimes on the project calls. 

But, new people are tuning in every week. I want to say– we are prepared to build with the community and go in the direction that the community wants us to go. This is what we wanted to create. We are almost done building. Once we are done, we are ready to give the community the reins. We are eager to continue building with you guys, and we are willing to deliver what the community wants. 

I personally think that is super powerful, and it is what decentralization is all about.

That's pretty much it for updates. 

I always like to turn it over to the community to check out what they are saying. 

## Community Questions ❓ [[30:38]](https://youtu.be/N9XX4RF8N64?t=1838)
(Questions from Discord in channel #project-management-calls)

**Mark:** Let me navigate to the project management channel where everyone asks us questions. 

I don't see any questions. I think we answered the questions already. 

Actually, this is a great question. I don't think we answered this one. 

**Tyler:** What is the question? Then we can figure out who answered it. 

**Mark:** I think we answered it.

The question is talking about gas and the number of OpenSea wallets. They are concerned about the effect of NFTs on L1, and it heads toward a conversation about L2. The question is somewhat dragged out. 

Simply it's asking, are we interested in L2's? Will we be building on them. When ETH 2.0 comes, and how that affects gas fees. That is a lengthy answer. 

I think Tyler and Troy could answer this a bit better. 

**Tyler:** Some of it is tough to know. The short answer is we are building the Polymorphs battle game on Polygon. Even for BarnBridge, we are looking into Optimism. We are looking at layer twos. If this activity in the ecosystem continues. We will inevitably have to build on them. There are rockstar developers on this project. The answer is yes. 

The difference will be; the best NFTs are on Ethereum. You can't avoid gas. You will pay gas fees to bridge your NFT to layer two in the first place. We will work on it, and we will build for layer twos. But, a lot of people still demand NFTs on Ethereum. 

That will affect how things work. That is a loaded question where we can have a conversation about NFT L2s. Someone could do a four-hour panel about that. We are definitely working on it– without question. Teams building a platform like Universe. Or even considering playing around with NFTs– in a meaningful way –is probably looking at L2s. And testing on/for them. 

**Mark:** Yeah! The entire industry is interested in layer twos. Obviously, Ethereum is building its L2. (ETH 2.0)

Our devs– especially George. Who technically is not our dev. He's his own person. George is extremely excited about Polygon. And the Hermes merger. (They will implement zk roll-ups) 

I've heard about people experimenting with zk's on ETH L1.

**Tyler:** Actually, that is a zk. It's a zero-knowledge proof on layer one. But, projects like Immutable are doing awesome things with zk's for NFTs. I believe that is where Illuvium is headed. 

**Troy:** Internally, we have started discussions about the Vitalik proposal and Ethereum research. Where he talks about cross-roll-up NFTs. I have had some preliminary conversations with George about that. It's an interesting concept because then everything can exist across all the roll-ups

Then the NFTs simply exist, and they span across everything all at once. That is a wild concept. There are a ton of options even Vitalik is proposing alternatives. I've never seen him talk much about NFTs. So, even he is working on things. There are certainly competitors out there for Ethereum. 

It's good to know that the ecosystem is working on solutions. Solana and Avalanche are doing things like this. They are there.

**Tyler:** You also have Dfinity, Flow etc.

In DeFi, we just got Optimistic roll-ups. That took Kain and the Optimism team a year to get everything situated. Arbitrum finally launched. I think Vitalik has mentioned in the past– zk roll-ups are the end game, and Optimistic roll-ups will come first. 

It appears that he was right– three years ago when he said it. The entire industry is looking at it. If people are building right now and not thinking deeply about layer two and how everything eventually works. I don't know, maybe they should start. To Troy's point, even Vitalik is talking about it at this point in time. 

**Troy:** I believe there is legit competition occurring. I'm a big fan of competition breeding innovation. It puts a fire under your ass, and I think it is a good thing. I believe we will see a lot of change over the next couple of months. But, I think it's healthy. Don't worry guys, we are watching it very closely, and we will maneuver how we need to. If you're with us, you can rest assured that we are looking towards the future. 

We are not going anywhere. 

**Mark:** Yeah! We have the best team. We will let you know right now we have the best teams all over. That's why we have the Tampa Bay Bucks. They are going to win tonight by 22. So, we are on the right teams if that is something you need to know. 

The winning teams. 

**Tyler:** We like to win. 

**Mark:** We like the wins.

**Al:** We have talked about many different ways to make the future drops have less gas. 

**Mark:** Oh yeah! Al, definitely mention this. I love this idea. 

I've seen some others mention good ideas. But, please, bring this up!

For NFTs in general! I think you made a great point.

**Al:** One of my favourite ones that were executed recently was for a project called Riot Racers. They released their NFTs on Polygon. They have been looking for a good way to drop NFTs. They do huge drops, and so they have only done three.

They are very competitive to get, so they have been experimenting. The most recent was amazing. You would navigate to the UI. Add one of the racers to your cart, and you buy it. But you were not actually buying it. You were transferring money to them– which tells them what car you want. 

When you add the racer to your cart, it gives you 15 minutes to buy while no one else could. If you didn't buy. Within enough time, it gets put back on the marketplace for everyone. 

You bought them on the Ethereum mainnet and simply paid a 10$ gas fee to transfer ETH to Riot Racer. Then they transfer the car for free on Polygon. That drop happened recently. When gas was super high. Everyone was worried about it right before they were dropping. Because no one could transfer ETH to Polygon for a good price.

So, they told us we wouldn't need to do that. Then we were worried about gas because it was the mainnet. However, it only ended up being **10$**. It was an excellent idea, and the team managed to execute a low gas drop. (During a time when gas was crazy for everyone)

We talked about other ways as well. I tell projects all the time (If it's not on Polygon) Something they can do with ease when gas is crazy. And there is high demand. They can do a right-to-buy raffle with multiple winners. Anyone who wins the raffle you set up a private sale, and they can buy it whenever they have the time or when gas goes down. 

That is another way to implement a low gas drop when gas is crazy. 

Also, if you have the tech for it, you can do mint passes or some sort of ticketing system. That is certainly something that we have talked about. 

We are not ignoring the gas situation. We have considered ideas and workarounds for future drops. We did not have time to implement anything for Lobby Lobsters because we wanted them released as soon as possible. That is an ongoing cause that we wanted to support quickly.

**Mark:** We probably won't figure this out within the next few months. We are focused on releasing the auctions, minting and the marketplace. Before we do any more NFT drops. 

Alright, everyone! We appreciate you!

We're all going to go because I need to go. So, thank you, everyone!
