## Intro

**Mark:** Welcome to AMA #15. 

We can get into some updates on the marketplace and the blockers we talked about last week on the project call. We've made good progress unlocking those systems, but we are still blocked on a few things. I can let Chuba talk about that and what we were able to make in the meantime.

## Marketplace & Blocker Updates üñº üöß [[00:35]](https://youtu.be/TfH2M727aI4?t=35)

**Ryan:** Over the last week, we've been able to consolidate and figure out who has access to what and what we need to resolve. We've reached out to various hosting providers in that discovery process, over phone calls and support tickets. The few things we still don't have access to will be recovered over the next few days. Measures will be taken to further decentralize the infrastructure between the various teams that contribute to Universe and geographically distribute access and ownership of the various infra. We are still blocked on a bit of the testing. Some of the features that we do have prepared and ready to go will still be delayed a little longer until we have everything wrapped up and under control. 

 A little bit of a holdover, but we're almost there. üôè

**Tyler:** I would like to highlight and I talked on the non-AMA portion, and again, out of respect for this person, I don't want to hold too many details, but we were held up for a while leading into this. We should have had systems in place and done things differently. It was the worst possible timing. In hindsight, there was a lot that we could have done to see it coming. We've been doing what we can; we launched the marketplace, got a couple of things immediately fixed, and have been blocked and locked out for a while now. Once we get access, the stuff we have been doing will get fixed rapidly. It's hard to describe how much of a setback it's been in general, on top of the tragedy of the situation. 

**Mark:** Some good things, however. We were able to recover access to some things already. We will be able to test some of these features and what we've been working on. We have been successful at further testing, but we will not be able to push these live until we get full access and recover everything. We don't have many more updates on the marketplace. 

We can hand it off to Zach; he has a ton of exciting and fun stuff today about the Polymorphs.

## Polymorphic Universe ü§° [[04:26]](https://youtu.be/TfH2M727aI4?t=266)

**Zach:** We've been secretly working on bringing our Polymorphs to life. If you read that medium article, you already know the direction behind it. I felt there was some storytelling missing from the NFTs. Polymorphs are a good place to start when developing a life form and bring them to NFTs. I hope you guys enjoy this Polymorphic Therapy episode. We have another two episodes. One is ready, and I'm not going to give exact timelines because it's not a good idea, but we will go live and share it with you. We have been working with talented animators and comedians on this, so it's coming together really well, and it's an enjoyable project to work on.

**Mark:** They are well-known comedy writers. Their group is called Good Liars, and they have been a part of many things. They have been involved with Adult Swim, productions, and groups. They have a bunch of funny and excellent content online. Hopefully, everyone loves the episodes, and we will continue to make them and bring the Polymorphs to life. As Zach said, we are trying to find a fun and creative way to get these guys to life and show people what they can do with their Polymorphs.

**Zach:** I think it's an exciting opportunity for the holders of the Polymorphs to have their Polymorphs featured in episodes. I don't have any concrete plans, but I want to get the community involved somehow. Maybe therapy meme competitions or something inside of our discord community. There can be a way for the community to vote on which Polymorphs are going to therapy next, or maybe influencing the session itself and how it goes. Feel free to share any ideas on how you think the best way to go about that or if you have any general ideas for the therapy sessions after you see the format today in an hour.

**Nick:** If you like how we're making them. We'll keep cramping them out, Whatever you want. ü¶æ

## Worldwide Web Metaverse üï∏ [[07:56]](https://youtu.be/TfH2M727aI4?t=476)

**Zach:** I should give an update on our worldwide web that we have all of our sprites prepared. I don't know if you guys know about the [worldwide web metaverse](https://twitter.com/Worldwide_WEB3), but I've delivered every Polymorph base character spreadsheet and all the endpoints. They recently let me know that they're postponing any future integrations until they do their next update so they can integrate more characters. 

When they do, you will be able to play worldwide web using whatever you own.

## NFT-NYC Event üé™ [[09:17]](https://youtu.be/TfH2M727aI4?t=557)

**Zach:** I also have an update on the party. This isn't all of the confirmed artists, but we have [Don Diablo](https://twitter.com/DonDiablo), [BT](https://twitter.com/BT) and [Vindata](https://twitter.com/vindata), performing at the [Monstercat Party in New York](https://twitter.com/Monstercat/status/1533901340501368832) in a couple of weeks. I've got some elevated Universe branding on display and laid out around the venue's decor. So if you are in New York, come hang out with me. I might even buy you a bagel. 

### [Polymorph Therapy Video Premier üé•](https://youtu.be/tf-6ele4-Co)

**Mark:** That's the majority of our updates. Once again, that Polymorphic Therapy video is going to air on YouTube. We're going to post a link in the discord that's on the Universe.XYZ DAO's official YouTube page and is set to premiere at 430 P. M. Eastern time. (it should be live) 

**Zach:** There is a chatbox during the premier. üòâ

**Mark:** It's a short video. It's about three minutes, but it's pretty funny. We can jump into the AMA section of the call.

## Temple‚Äî SOON üßò [[11:31]](https://youtu.be/TfH2M727aI4?t=691)

**Nick:** Temple is coming soon. That's also an update. ü§ù

**Mark:** Temple is getting close, but we're still laying low on telling everybody what it is. 

Now it's the forum and community questions. 

Tyler, do you want to answer these questions from JD Buffalo?

## Community Questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Runway for the marketing? The vision for the role of the community?

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** The vision for the community's role is that we've hired out of the community quite a bit. The biggest thing when people ask me is that it is hard to figure out because people come in and start contributing and helping immediately. In Universe's case, I get that it's been slow-going since we launched, we had unforeseen circumstances and things slowed down progress. We have been hit with a series of bad luck streaks that I wouldn't expect would continue. Our USDC runway and the multi-sig are fine in terms of the runway. We need to recalibrate how much the multi-sig has fronted towards the Polymorphs. Someone had said before that we had not spent any money on the Polymorphs, but that's not completely true. We have a certain amount of funds used for NFTs, which would also extend the runway.

We need to look at the general markets and see where everything's going; it's not like we will run out of money immediately. Suppose Universe Aggregate was a private entity. You see groups raising quite a lot of capital, $20-$30 million. Since everything we're doing is publicly listed, when you hit these bear markets, it becomes difficult when the public markets are highly active. We need to get into a presentable place, and if we're going to compete long term, we're going to have to raise or find capital. We need to get everything cleaned up and push it out before worrying about that. We can have open questions when we need to worry about the runway.

In terms of the Monstercat event, Tim can come to talk about that. The way I view that is it was voted on and passed.

I didn't see a ton of pushback until after it passed. I didn't think it was a problem or a significant issue. Since it's passed, it looks worse if we go to Monstercat and say "the community is pushing back against this passing, and we can't do it anymore". The last time we did all this, the markets were active, and everything on NFTs was on fire. The people who went to the event at the time were positively viewed and received by everyone. Tim and I paid for that. We scaled it back this time around and decided not to hit it as hard. We need to stay on top of tracking the ROI.

This was in motion before everything happened, and we had been talking with the Monstercat team and this happens in bear markets. You start to look at every dollar closely, the result is we begin to look at this event more closely than we did last time. If we don't show up to this event because we had a big presence last time, it starts to look like the projects dying. When this event begins Universe will be shipping. 

 One of the worst things we could do is be invisible because it was hard even to get a voice or eyes on what we were doing when everything was going bonkers. I think continuing at the pace we were at, more people will pay attention if we increase what we're doing with the Polymorph. These things may seem small, but eventually, people start to notice. 

It's a fair criticism. We need to be more critical and pay attention to the ROI. Look at what we get out of it because $100,000 isn't a minuscule amount. 

**Zach:** I brought JD Buffalo up. He had his hand up; hes raising the questions on this so we could talk to him.

**Community Member:** I had two quick follow-ups, and I appreciate the answer. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

The first one is on the comments on the runway. It doesn't seem like you're comfortable talking about the length of time you can continue operating, and I respect that. I'm not going to argue with you.

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** It's partially because we are cutting some expenses in various areas that have to do with some art creation. We did spend quite a lot of money getting the back end up. So our month-to-month runway rate is dropping, and we're working on figuring out exactly what that is. As far as the runway goes, we have excellent capital partners who would come to help for numerous reasons. I don't want to say they're not our fault because that makes it sound flippant, but some things were out of our control and caused setbacks that don't reflect directly on the team. I don't think we will have an issue if we need to shore up more capital. We still haven't touched the capital that was raised from the Polymorphs. While ETH has dropped, there's still capital there in these markets. In terms of six months to a year, I don't have confidence that the project will end or fall apart if we have issues.

We watch the runway and make sure that we don't hit a wall. Some of the groups we work with have announced massive raises. We didn't spin out of control like Luna or Terra. None of the funds we work with were super involved in that ecosystem. 

If we start to run out of capital, we can get it in this market.

**Community Member:** The language is a bit of a change from what you were talking about a few months ago. I remember talking about a long runway, self-funded, and we're not going to have to raise capital, which could be changing. The other question that I've been hammering on is the party and it is what it is. It sounds like it's 1500 people already familiar with and involved in the ecosystem. The only real questions I had were. 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

What goes into determining the ROI?

I wonder if that's the best way to spend funds in a bear market when your reach doesn't seem like it could be that high relative to what could be using that money to do something else?

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** I think that's fair. 

**Zach:** We had this party planned and planned on doing this with Monstercat beforehand. I wasn't a part of the team last year, and I went as a community member, and it was worth the money. I had a great time, and the Universe brand was strong there. Some people might disagree, but the agreement was that we do it again next year. It's a bear market now, but it wasn't a bear market when we started planning for this Monstercat party.

**Ryan:** Then to add because a few others had asked about it.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Now that the app is launched we should start tracking traffic metrics, step-to-step metrics/page-over-page metrics for the user journey.
I would say that you could also look at general traffic metrics soon after the party to see if it has any effect on product use.
 
### **Answer:**
 
**Ryan:** We're recapturing a lot of the infrastructure; you might be able to get some analytics in place so that we're able to track some of the usage metrics of the platform and visits to the homepage and conversion. So we can see whether it's big or small events, which one leads to active users and which one leads to people going to the home page and never coming back. Not saying this can happen overnight, but it's good to start exploring. It may be something the community will want to see in the long run.

**Mark:** We've been trying to grow social media. So looking at those KPIs and website traffic and marketplace usage, we can get enough data to measure if it was large enough to justify there. We can try to measure some form of ROI. Whether it be an activity, it would be harder to put a dollar amount on that, but we know how much we spent on the party if that makes sense.

**Tyler:** We need to make sure that we're engaged and focused in the NFT industry in general because people talk to other industry experts on whether things are legit or not. Among groups in the NFT ecosystem, we still have name recognition and respect. Those are the people I want to make sure we don't completely stop reaching out to. We could have unmeasurable ramifications from that. 

Jd Buffalo, your question about runway, it's not that there's a massive pivot or shift in the way I'm talking about it. I'm watching some of the private raises in the market, and even in a down market, I'm seeing the NFT ecosystem launch on Cosmos to raise $30 million.

We need to raise capital to compete with those types of things long term. Our entire market cap as other groups raises, and they don't have the same kind of tech or longevity. These same groups are going to realize how hard this is to build. Going back a little to say yes, I think we're going to need to expand, which can't come out of my and Troy's pockets. When that time comes, the people in funds not active in discord are still engaged and have goodwill with them. 

**Community Member:** I've said my piece on it and made my stance pretty clear over the last couple of weeks. So I appreciate you guys engaging with me, and hopefully, we can take some stuff away from this moving forward and maybe do things a little differently.

**Zach:** I appreciate you for being honest. If anybody else wants to come up and speak, then raise your hand. I'll bring you up if you have any questions.

Was there anything else in the pre-ama?

**Mark:** I didn't see anything. I think we're good. ü´°

**Zach:** One more person is typing. Let's see if they have anything to say.

Please make sure you guys are in that YouTube Premier link. I'll make sure I drop it in the discord. 

**Mark:** Thank you, everyone. 

**Zach:** Talk to you guys later. Bye.  ‚úåÔ∏è

**Tyler:** Stay safe, guys. üíô
