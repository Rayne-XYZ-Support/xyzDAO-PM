## Intro

**Mark:** We'll start the AMA off and do it the same way we have been the last few weeks. We'll answer questions. Today we are giving access to the Marketplace. It is the beta.

**Tyler:** It's on the main net, and it is the live version of the Marketplace. If anybody goes on there and lists something for a ridiculous price and sells it, it will sell out of your real wallet. 

**Mark:** The link is in the Pre AMA, and Tyler sent the password and username. I'll resend the link one more time, so everyone here has it. Copy and paste that. I don't know why I didn't post it as a link, but that's the link. So we're going to run back up to the top and answer these questions. 

## Pre AMA Questions ?

### **Question:**

James F asked; He was trying to understand when we would be able to use the Marketplace?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We were hoping it would be a few days ago, but it's today. We're giving access to everyone today. We feel it's in the right place to let the community start trying to use it. I think we've smoothed out the majority of all the bugs. All the contracts are working as designed, and we had a few things we needed to work on. One of them is that not all of the NFTs are showing up. Our back-end scraper is still catching up. It has to scrape the entire blockchain over 6 to 7 years. There are a lot of NFTs that it's scraping; it's scraping the new NFTs and going back in time at the same time.

Some of your older NFTs probably aren't showing up. Some of the newer ones are. We're trying to go in and load as many NFT collections as we can that we know people are interested in right away, so we can prioritize them in the queue. We've already prioritized the top 230 all-time collections. So far, that's honestly what we have. But we feel we have a beta that is in good enough shape that everyone can start using it and start listings and buy NFTs there. We wanted to give early access to the people who joined this AMA today because we appreciate everyone who joins our AMAs.

Chuba, I can't hear you.

**Ryan:** I was saying on the data that if you see NFTs that you think should be in the top 200 and aren't showing up, let us know, and we'll try to deal with that as quickly as we can. Then for other collections, we can have DAO Votes through snapshot to get it in very quickly. Otherwise, all new collections deployed will be going forward, and we'll still be scraping the chain going back. I know people want to get certain collections listed. I think going old snapshot is going to be the best way to do that.

**Mark:** We didn't want to delay the scraper catching up because we don't know how long it would take. After all, there are new NFTs minted every day. It's very hard to determine many unknowns or how long it will take to get all of them. We didn't want to take that extra time because we know people are very interested in being able to use a decentralized alternative.

**Tyler:** It will eventually scrape all of them, though.

**Mark:**  It'll get there. 

**Ryan:** We'll have every NFTs, 721, and 1155 scraped, but it will take time. We have to process every single block in the blockchain.

**Tyler:** At that point, it will be scraping faster than OpenSea.

**Ryan:** Yeah.

**Mark:** So that everyone knows how this process is going to work from now on, now that the Marketplace is out, we're going to be rigorously moving to get the rest of the features that we have written out. We have many different contracts that we have written, and the UI is done. It's just that we got to integrate all of these things. And we need to release it in steps. It's just easier to scale everything this way. We will know what's breaking versus just dropping everything at once if something breaks. But we do have more to drop. This is a bare-bones Marketplace; first, we are going to release all of these features within 1-2 months. Have a lot more features and a lot more types. You'll have bundles listings; you will be able to add floor bids. Genie, our Gem, will be integrating with us very soon. I think they're ready to go. We have other minting contracts and different; I don't want to drop too much alpha on some of these things that were dropping.

We have some awesome, really cool custom minting contracts that people are going to be able to get creative with. So I'll leave it at that. We are going to add anything that you see grayed out. We have more features that you don't even see in the UI right now. So there's a lot to look forward to. It's just that we need to release it in steps. 

### **Question:**

So Resistance has a question; 
1. Wen new UI for airdrop? 
2. What is this collection about?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** So we have the AirDrop UI done. We just haven't implemented it. We were going to do it a few weeks ago, and then we all got extremely busy with the Marketplace. It's just been the priority, and we have been focused on it. I'll try to get it launched next week, but I think the main focus is still going to be on the Marketplace. All we have to do is publish it. I just need to talk with Vahan and make sure that everything's up to date and good there.

We should be able to push that live.

Sorry, this Universe singularity collection. That was our original; I want to say our second take on our minting contract; that collection it's still live. You can go mint to the contract, but we're not going to let you can go mint to them from Etherscan. There was a bug, and we needed to fix it. So we took the contract off, fixed the bug, and redeployed. There's nothing wrong with those NFTs. It's just that we needed to make the fix. We did, and that's ka dead collection. That was the old Universe. Anyone can mint this contract the same way OpenSea has a contract, and Rariable has those. Tyler's playing with his Enter DAO NFTs. Then he goes in to talk about regarding if voting will be incentivized? I think we've talked about this before. Yours incentivize for staking in the DAO. I mean, we don't incentivize you to vote. If you want to vote, it's up to you, but your incentive to vote is wanting to improve the Marketplace and improve the DAO.

If you're holding XYZ for the incentive of being, I want to vote and be rewarded; then I think we need to think of the mindset as the incentive is that we get to do. We're running companies completely like this; this isn't a company. We get to have a say on what we all will do and build. I think that's an awesome incentive. But the team hasn't discussed if you all want to incentivize voting. The DAO has the ability to go and vote and make that happen. We can probably put some systems in place, but we have to talk about that as a community.

**Tyler:** I mean, everybody can push proposals forward if they're smart. We will support them.

**Add Speaker:** And a well-thought plan. You have to plan where those funds will be coming from. Perhaps it needs to be well thought out and have a vision of where we're trying to go with our ETHos.  

**Mark:** I'm just going to skip over this discussion because this is a lot for me to read. I'll come back to it and put my input in Discord. I like this idea of giving POAPS for voting. We can take snapshots after every vote. We did take a snapshot after the last vote to launch the Marketplace, so we've thought about it, but we haven't decided anything. To launch the Marketplace because that's what we've all been waiting for. And obviously, we're going to do something with that list. And Zach's already dropped POAPs, but it seems like not everybody got them. So we'll try and figure that out with POAP. It was something to do with their server, and it wasn't working the day that Zach tried to do it.  

### **Question:**

Are there any plans to add additional ERC? Oh, wait a minute. I think I skipped over TaeKwonKrypto; How many days away before I can upload a comment cover and sell ERC 1155?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We're going to add ERC 1155. That's going to be something to come in one of the later iterations of the Marketplace. But like we said, we're starting with ERC 721 and some basic Marketplace features; there's more coming; it's done. We have to scale it out, build it out, and make sure that when we're releasing something and adding something, it's not going to break something else. We wanted to get something out sooner rather than later to everybody so they can start using something. But yes, 1155s are coming, and we're going to look at Layer 2 assets. Any plans to add ERC 20 tokens as payment options? Yes, we're starting with USDC ETH, Wrapped ETH, XYZ, and DAI. If people want to see tokens get added, we can run that through governance and get any token added that people want. I'm sure many people will want to see tokens like the Apecoin get added but let's make those decisions through governance.

**Tyler:** Someone's wilding.

**Mark:** Someone's balling.

A feature request form. James F, I tagged Rayne on your post, and he added a feature request form in the Pre AMA channel. We can also add that in the announcements channel to make it easier for everybody to find.

## Shoutout:

**Tyler:** Shout out to Hal Finney for talking about NFT trading cards back in 1993.

**Mark:** Can we also post that and announcements so that everyone sees it. It's a good announcement.

**Tyler:** Hal Finney will only use Universe when he returns from the dead due to cryogenic freezing.

**Mark:** You heard it here first. Hal Finney is going to use Universe. 

### **Question:**

Do you plan on rewarding activities on the platform to boost its launch? It doesn't look like it, but better to ask. 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We have plans, but we have not publicly said what they are.

**Tyler:** If we're going to do something, I think it's most likely that we should incentivize listings because I've talked about this in-depth. But OpenSeas Monopoly is around their listings. If you even look at where Looks Rariable is getting organic volume. It's from the Jim. So I think over time, with our auctions and minting and many things happening on our platform. It will not be out of the gate that we catapult in volume. But I think that we're launching now. It will be a long work that we keep pushing forward.

**Algy:** If I mute you, just tell us in the Pre AMA channel if you want to come up and talk.

### **Question:**

What is Universe Singularity?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Multiverse Singularity is the name of our contract. It's the name we chose for the minting contracts. It was some sort of space thing. I forget exactly why we named it that. Anyone can mint to that contract. Otherwise, you have to create your own collection. When you create your own collection, you're creating your own minting contract that only you can mint too. Many people in the industry asked for this a year ago, so we did it, but it took us a little bit. It costs a little bit of money to deploy. The last time I was looking, it was $150 to $250 to deploy 1 of those contracts. But then, when you're minting to it, it's $30 depending on the qwei. If you want to mint directly to that Universe Contract, you can. It's like the Rariable Contract where you can just mint, and it's a Rariable NFT. It's not part of any collection. Could we add more messaging around the decentralization aspect?

I think many people would move their NFT over if some were messaging around it?

**Tyler:** Well, I think we should is the short answer. But why do you think that it would get people to move over? Because I think that's how we need to be approaching what the messaging is.

**Mark:** We are looking into making a video explaining how Universe is decentralized. We've already started it, but we are working on the copy and the wording of how we say it is decentralized. But we'll try to release a 2-3 minute video on all the aspects of how it's decentralized. One of the people who do those videos for us is Ivan, he actually lives in Ukraine, and he hasn't been making as many videos right now. He's been able to edit some of them, but we've been giving him a little bit of a break because of what is going on over there. He's still working, but we have that other video we're going to work on, and we have to finish still. But we'll get that out, James F. 

### **Question:**

I like how you gotchi incentivized voting by rewarding in Game XP for participation. (leading to in-game stat boosts). Something we can explore further once Polymorphs utility is deployed.

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Interesting.

**Tyler:** Send us a link on how that works.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Tyler:** Again, incentivizing voting is tough since if we're talking about incentivizing anything, I think it has to be even more than voting right now. Getting listings on the platform is very important; that has to be a vote.

### **Question:**

Will Universe have a similar token staking mechanism? Like Looks Rare? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** No, we're not. If the DAO wanted to vote and do something like that, we could decide that through governance as a community. But the team will not set anything like that up on our own. But good question. Many people ask that. 

### **Question:**

What about a Doc or channel for requested collections? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** In Discord, that wouldn't be a bad idea. Honestly, it's a good idea.

**Rayne:** I can make another form for that. So it doesn't just get cluttered because we can make a super small form that people can send the contract address to, and then we can query it and see if we should add it.

**Mark:** Can we just make a channel and make that form the only thing there and don't let people type. Just leave that form.

**Rayne:** Yeah, I'll put that. Maybe we move project requests and feature requests to the channel. That's easy to find.

**Add Speaker:** Tyler just made add a project request right here.

**Rayne:** Do it similarly to Rariable, or they did before.

**Mark:** Sorry for the delay, guys. We're trying to set that up quickly. 

### **Question:**

Okay, Fluffer Nutter's question; Can I have an option to get paid for my NFT in more than one token? Like list my NFT for 4 ETH or the equivalent of XYZ, can receive a combo of both or the full amount in either token. 
 
#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** No, you can't. But if you guys want to do that, we can make a contract that allows you to do that; that's tough. I don't know if that's possible. We would probably have to upgrade the contracts to add that feature. I probably can't answer that question because I don't know if that is possible. I think it's possible, but I don't know if we can just upgrade it willy-nilly like that. That's a good question. Is Ryan here?

**Ryan:** Yeah, what's up? Sorry, I'm working on the Marketplace.

**Mark:** FlufferNutter asked, Is it possible to get paid for an NFT and multiple tokens? Like if he wanted to get paid 4 ETH, but someone wanted to offer 2 ETH and then 20,000 XYZ just to make it simple math.

**Ryan:** I think we can support that without a smart contract upgrade using ERC 20 bundles. I'd have to look into it, but I think it could be possible.

**Mark:** Okay, well, there's your answer. That's a great question. Fluffer Nutter.

**Ryan:** We can always do a DAO vote. So nothing's off the table.

### **Question:**

Yes. Okay. James F asked another question; You all brought up additional functionality for XYZ in the past. What's the plan on that? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We've answered this question for the last three weeks. Troy comes up and talks about this. He's not giving too much information about it, but there is planned utility. We'll just leave it at that. But yes, we do have plans, and no, we're not going to say it just yet, but when all that stuff is ready, it's going to be badass.

**Troy:** I mean, if I could give a little. The new Graviton website launched, and there's some stuff on there that provides a little bit of an update on this. The token will be mined through a live streaming service, and anyone who contributes GPU power to this system will be able to mine XYZ. I'm going to leave it at that, though. There's also some other stuff we're working on, but I just can't talk about it.

**Mark:** Thanks, Troy.

**Troy:** Hey, man, any time.

**Mark:** Okay. Tyler likes James F and his ideas.

**Mark:** Okay. Here's Marklar sending this stuff on, Avagotchi. Okay. Does anybody have any other questions? I mean, it's exciting. We're super close.

### **Question:**

Sick Navi is coming in here and asking some questions; What can the community do to help at University succeed the most? For example, like listing migrations? Is it better if we cancel other listings? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Okay, so those are all really good questions. So really, the best thing that anyone can do for Universe right now is honestly test the Marketplace and give us your honest and best feedback. We want to hear from you guys and what the community wants. We're here to accept criticism. Another thing that anyone can do is tell your friends about us, like a retweet, follow, and share, that there is a decentralized competitor in the space coming, and we have been building for the last year, and we wanted to build this thing right. We knew it took longer than expected, but many people know about the Universe. I think some people need to be reminded that it's finally launching because we have been building this thing for the last ten months.

And another thing, too, is exactly what Navi is saying: migrating listings over is probably another way to help. Tyler mentioned that earlier. OpenSea has quite the monopoly on listings. That's partially why their volume is so crazy. But moving listings over, telling your friends, explaining that we're a decentralized alternative, honestly giving your best feedback back to us, and how can we improve to help the Marketplace and help Universe? 

**Ryan:** Let me bounce off you, Mark, on this with the spreading that we're a DAO in the community, and actually, you can participate in it. I think what would be helpful is you guys with collections that aren't showing up, and there's going to be a lot of those at first. It's going to get better and better can go in and talk with each other and say, which ones do you want to see? Come in first and start making proposals, and they will get pulled in quickly after that. I think it would be a good community effort and an actionable way to help the Marketplace bootstrap our data scraper?

**Mark:** I think that's a really good point. We all buy a lot of NFTs, but we don't buy all of them. We know there are cool collections that we don't even know about that some people love and want to have and see in their wallets. So Ping us. I think we're adding a channel for collections to be added. Rayne is working on that, and we'll be able to prioritize those collections that people care about the most. Then that scraper will eventually catch up, and we're going to be able to have all those NFTs available in our wallets.

### **Question:**

There's a good question here; Will each collection project needs to update the information on each collection? 

#### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** So each project has to update its royalties. That has to be done to get the royalty set up. If you want royalties on a collection you own, you can update royalties on the collection page. If there is no collection page, you can reach out, and we'll help it get all set up on the side of collection descriptions and names. For now, you can update them manually on our site on the Marketplace Alpha link. That has been passed around a little bit, which will stay on in the process. If you update it now, it'll stay alive. We will be pulling in more descriptions and names of collections, images, etc. But for now, you'll be able to update them at the very least. Then if you don't like the updates that we pull in in the future, you can always change them again.

**Mark:** We will tweet to have some of the collections try to reach out to us. But another thing that as a community can help with, too, is if you're very active in a certain Discord like Doodles or Board Ape Yacht Club, and you're talking with the Founders of one of those projects, you're like, hey, Universe is dropping. I can get you in touch with Mark, Ryan or Tyler and message us and link us together with them because the Board Ape team is not easy to get in touch with. But we don't want collections like that to feel like they got burned because people went and were trading, and they hadn't set up their royalties. So a really good way for everyone to come out and help us would be to chime in your favourite Discords and invite them to our Discord and fill out one of those forms or get them in a chat room with us where we can do our best to guide them to get everything set up and help all these collections.

**Ryan:** Sorry, I might have skipped over some questions there.

**Mark:** Yeah, you did. But it's all good. 

### **Question:**

Is the best way to coordinate marketing strategy by making proposals via DAO? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Everyone asks about marketing. What do you guys want? Marketing like you want to do paid Twitter ads. Tyler and I used to run a marketing agency, and we don't think that spending money on marketing is like doing commercials. I mean, there are TV commercials. 

**Ryan:** Maybe we can come up with something creative. You can probably chat in Discord about it first and maybe make a forum proposal. Then once there's an idea formulated on exactly what you'd want to do and what kind of budget it's looking like, you could put that up for a snapshot vote and then an on-chain vote to get the voting source. But I don't have any ideas on that front, just highlighting how you would go if that is an avenue you want to contribute towards.

**Mark:** We are expanding our social media range to other platforms outside of Twitter. We have almost 25,000 followers on Twitter. We've never bought a follower. Organic growth in this industry outpaces trying to pay for clicks. Or, if you guys want, we can start promoting our tweets on Twitter.

**Tyler:** We've never bought a single thing in crypto-based on an ad versus word of mouth; word of mouth works better. The best thing I think we can do from a word of mouth perspective. I know many people in this Discord and are major FLUF fans on this AMA. So if we can get all the FLUF people to list everything in the FLUF ecosystem, we can start listing. If you have a Polymorph for sale on OpenSea, relist it on Universe. You only have to approve the Polymorph contract once, and then you can list all of the things for essentially free. So let's say you have 20 Polymorphs listed. You're going to pay a $9 fee to approve the Polymorphs, and then you can relist all of them again. But I think that long-term things like Polymorphs and Deviants are coming and Seekers, Party Bears, ASM Brains, AFA, FLUFs and Lobby Lobsters.

**Mark:** We are talking with them.

**Tyler:** We don't have much to build on if we can't win against OpenSea on those projects. So I thought that talking to communities close to us built with us in many ways. Some of the attachment to us even legitimized us in the early days when we just rolled up our sleeves and tried to help them. I would like it if a lot of those projects return the favour. I can tell their Founders that, but it's a big difference if people in their community list on Universe.

**Mark:** And we're talking with those guys; we're super aligned with Aaron and David and that whole ecosystem.

**Tyler:** Right. But it's one thing for me to talk to Aaron and David. It's another thing for active people because I can't be active in the FLUFs Discord. As much as I love FLUFs, I have much other stuff on my plate. But people who are active in that Discord are active in flipping NFTs. The best thing that we can do is that there are no incentivized listings to try to get people.

**Mark:** Yeah, it's going to be a battle. 

### **Question:**

Is the Universe Foundation planning to raise more institutional money at some point, or are we done?

#### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** The Universe doesn't have a foundation. And honestly, I think that if we realize that we're at a good spot in terms of funding at the Multi SIG. We'll have some creative ways to do it over time if we want to get more capital in the treasury to compensate people working on the project. We can pay attention to some of what happens at the rollout of Barnbridge and that DAO. We can ultimately play it by ear. But right now, we're not undercapitalized. We're under-talented. We always need more talent. So I don't think capital is the issue right now.

### **Question:**

James F asks; How are we moving FLUFs and associated projects over? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Tyler was talking about this.

### **Question:**

But I just thought of something because I'm reading through more questions, and; avgmayosandwich is saying some stuff; You can talk to XYZ. You can't talk to OpenSea.

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** There's a button on the FLUFs website that is a view on OpenSea. So maybe we can talk to Aaron about getting that switched from OpenSea to Universe.

**Tyler:** Even some of our stuff like Enter DAO and Sharded Minds. We should definitely get to go.

**Mark:** Well, here's one thing that I've already been talking about people are going to want. Okay, I'll drop alpha because I've already talked to David and Aaron about this. Our ecosystem partners, like Enter DAO, the FLUF Burrows. There are a lot of cool items.

Hold on. Let me finish this because this is important. I think people are going to like this. So when you have an ASM brain, you're going to be able to put it in a FLUF. You're going to be able to do all this other stuff. But what if I've already talked to David, and I said we can put buttons on the Marketplace that's, put this in another NFT and then okay, you have your FLUF Burrow. How about I have a button that brings me directly to my burrow? I don't have to go to the underground, click through all this stuff, and go to my burrow. It's like, okay, I have it right here. Boom. Click and go there. And then integrate buttons, maybe put a swap feature for and just make the UI more friendly to those collections. People are going to want to use them because we can easily just integrate the underground into our Marketplace. Even Enter DAO can rent an asset out of the front end. That's one thing that many people maybe not realize. But any NFT minted on Universe Contracts is compatible with Enter DAO, Land Works, Land Writing, and they call it Land Works. But you can rent any NFT. You could rent out your polymer for a party or something.

**Tyler:** Which will be important when it comes to gaming. One thing I was going to say is that I just hired a UI UX person who I'm going to start designing figmas of a Marketplace. I don't know their tech stacks, a custom Marketplace for certain projects, and flipping them to the Founders of those projects. So it's not like we can code them for them. But if we get to that point and that's successful, maybe we start coding them and open source them and give them out. But realistically, if FLUFs had a Marketplace on their site, it's most likely going to be Universe because we'll probably help them build that. I would say the same with Sharded Minds. Enter DAO is going to build into it. We go to Polygon like League DAO, and I've even talked to Fractional, and we could probably do something like that with Charged Particles. So we need to get as many listings as possible. And that is one of the ways that I think will work to do that. 

**Mark:** I think adding features to, and even we're going to do this to our NFTs, you're going to be able to scramble your Polymorph from the Marketplace. 

**Troy:** That's where the whole finders fee stuff comes in. You can build out your own interface on top of the Marketplace, and that's the big incentivization because then the front end can also take a cut, and those types of features should end up more over on their sites. And then they plug in almost like plugging into a back end to our Marketplace, and that's where that stuff starts to get interesting.

**Mark:** Just to access liquidity.

**Troy:** Exactly.

**Mark:** Super interesting.

**Troy:** Gravitons are working on some stuff like that too. Some of the applications that are being built will use Universe Marketplace, but there'll be a front end built on top of it. And then Graviton, the company, takes a finder's fee, but everything will be listed on the Universe Marketplace, and you'll be able to find it on Universe Marketplace. Still, you'll also be able to find a specific collection like that specific collection of what it's connected to. I'm not going to say what that is yet, but it will be listed on the front end of Graviton. But it will still be using Universe's Marketplace, and there will be a fee-sharing system where that's what that finder's fee is. So the collection front end that uses the Marketplaces back end, that front end takes a cut, but then the line share goes to the Universe Marketplace, so they don't have to build their own on-chain liquidity system. If you think about it, it's how Uniswap works, which we've been saying. This is the Uniswap for NFTs.

### **Question:**

Hardware wallet timeline?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** That is something we're working on. We're trying to get it live insanely quickly. We are sorry that that is buggy. We're having an issue with the signing on the hardware wallets. Even with the Metamask integrations with Ledger, the Devs are working on it right now. In the near foreseeable future, we are going to solve that. We're trying to tweak out some of these last bugs and get some of these last things working properly. But still, we think that it was in a place where we could at least share this with everyone to come out and help us test a little more. But Rambler, it's the common man. 

### **Question:**

Can we keep the Google sheet open for additional feedback? Do we have a Google sheet open right now? Make a list today because I'm familiarizing myself with the site now,  but can we do it again in another week if we need to?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think it was just the Google Form; we can leave the Google Form open. People can come and constantly try to add future requests, and we'll be going through those, and we'll decipher through there. And then we need to maybe come up with an idea of maybe if we get so many of the same feature requests, we'll create a snapshot proposal, and the community can vote on it.

But we're not just going to go and upgrade every single feature that someone requests. If there are bugs, we need to fix the bugs, but feature requests are going to be handled a little bit differently than bug requests.

### **Question:**

I'm not sure how this is a complaint. His NFT got frozen on OpenSea. Yeah, I think the question is; Will Universe freeze NFTs if they report it stolen?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think we can freeze NFTs, but we can pull them off our front-end interface. Are we not going to freeze any NFTs? 

**Tyler:** That's a Ryan question because I don't know the legality.

**Add Speaker:** The legality is that we have to take them off the front end.

If you want to plug into our back end.

We can't stop you.

**Tyler:** I don't think OpenSea can do that either, to be honest. I believe they are just freezing it on their front end. Maybe part of the giving permission to OpenSea allows them to do that, but I think my gut says they're just freezing on their front end. But I don't know how OpenSeas Contracts work because they're not open source. So maybe when you approve something on OpenSea, it gives them the ability to do that. And if that's true, that's not good that a centralized tech company owns that power. Our smart contracts don't give us the ability to freeze NFTs. But if something nefarious happens and the FBI shows up at my house, it is coming off the interface, not going to jail for people doing stupid s--t on Universe.

**Ryan:** anything illegal will be pulled from the front end, hopefully quickly. Beyond that, we can have DAO Votes if people want to have certain content pulled. I don't have any clear specifications around how it would look, but we ultimately can't stop things moving through the contracts want to pop up and offer those listings on their site through our website.

**Tyler:** I think that was what he was asking. He was saying that's his point. We will pull it off. If we get DCMA, we're going to comply. That's not our legal battle to fight on behalf of the industry. Go ahead if you want to launch your own Marketplace and plug into our protocol. But we're not going to show it on ours if we have to respond to a DCMA because otherwise, they'll just hit Amazon with the DCMA and the whole Marketplace goes down. This isn't pure anarchy. We still have to live by the rule of law. I think it's a really good question because I have never considered how sketchy that is that OpenSea can freeze people's property.

**Mark:** I think they can move NFTs, too.

**Ryan:** Yeah. I don't want to speculate on what OpenSea can and can't do just because I'm not 100% sure.

**Tyler:** We can tell you what we can do, and I mean, trust and verify. You can look for yourself at the contracts or open source.

**Ryan:** Right. I think creators should not worry about their content just being pulled one day. If, for some reason, your content is questionable or up for debate, whether it's graphic or whatever it may be. People want to have a vote around it; you'll have the opportunity to have a say and come up with a reason why you believe it should stay and should Universe, and it ultimately is up to the community because it's a DAO and that's how I think it should be. I think everyone agrees, or I would hope so.

### **Question:**

MrSacks has a question; Are there future plans for Metaverse collaborations? Get NFTs Land listed on Universe Marketplace?  

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Like the FLUF Burrows, he talked about adding a button to allow you to jump and leap right in. I don't understand why Medaverse Land doesn't already have more buttons where you can click right in. Crypto Voxels, you can go and click on the link, like on OpenSea, and then it brings you to Crypto Voxels. But I think you should have a button that just deploys you directly into that piece of property. So you could do a 360 walk-through, the same way people do real estate viewings now because of Covid. We're going to try to integrate cool stuff like that. That puts you through a portal to where you need to be. We're going to partner with them and do our best to do what they want because I'm sure these projects want added features that we haven't even thought of. So we'll see what they want to do as well. We do have plans to collaborate with a lot of different groups.

I mean, renting out an asset for the Metaverse with Ender DAO and putting that on our interface because you own a Crypto Voxels plot or a JawDo jet pack. Do you want to rent that out to someone in the Metaverse? That's powerful. Then something that's also extremely powerful that I think is going to bootstrap the Metaverse is the fact that we're a liquidity layer protocol in a Metaverse. We have built the contracts that you can now plug into. You can now buy something off the wall, and these Crypto Vauxhalls in the central will have to integrate with our back end. But they can create a widget now in the Metaverse, which will connect to our smart contracts. You'll be able to make a sale because anyone in some of the current Metaversus knows that you have to leave crypto Voxels or some of these sites to make the sale. I think it's super powerful to be able to buy something off the wall. Our smart contracts are something that is going to make that possible.

**Mark:** We will have to see them integrate and partner with us on this. 

### **Question:**

Will there be a dark mode? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think we have a dark mode. It might not be coded yet or live on whatever you're looking at, but I'm sure there's a dark mode in the design. Okay, well, it'll get made; dark mode is on the way.

**Algy:** We should have had that pushed at launch. I don't know why we didn't.

**Mark:** Technically, we're not even launched right now. So everyone right now has early access to the beta. This is an early look; I mean, this is bare bones. I'm not going to lie. We have stuff coming. For some of our minting contracts, we will not say what they are just because of how unique and cool they are. We don't want people trying to front-run us on what we've done. Tim Kang has been crushing it on writing. He's the smart contract, God. He has created some creative and interesting minting contracts that we will be plugging in soon. We have 3 or 4 types of NFT minting that nobody has ever seen before.

**Tyler:** someone bought my ETH Lizard on this call from Universe.

**Mark:** Damn. Someone bought Tyler's ETH Lizard. Welcome to the ETh Lizard family. I changed my background to an ETH Lizard today.

**Ryan:** That's the first sale on the Marketplace from the community.

**Mark:** Let's go. Tyler GGS

**Ryan:** The DAO earned .005 ETH fees or something like that. You're on the team, fella.

**Mark:** Okay, people, I'm reading. YouTube videos that are boring in instructional. Okay, this is all pretty good. Thank you, JVK. These are all really good ideas. 

**Mark:** Okay, thank you, Fluffer Nutter, for listing your FLUFs. We appreciate you, but honestly, if you're selling FLUFs, you're probably not going to make it. But I know you have probably 30 FLUFs. Maybe you should consider it; I guess listing them will help. Okay, everyone can help by speaking up a bit about the power of Universe XYZ. Thank you, Knowledgeable Idiot. The power goes back to that. The whole thing is that we're a DAO, all in control, and we're in this together. We're going to build this Marketplace together. We built the bones. Let's get the flesh going. And I think all of us need to do that together. We can't do it by ourselves at this point. We need the community to help push this thing. The best marketing is having people with a large following on Twitter that are legit? We have some legit people that we can have to promote the Marketplace, and we'll work on that, James F. okay, there's just a lot of chatter.

**Mark:** I'm not sure if these are questions.

Sorry, guys. I'm just trying to read through all this. We're getting many questions, but some of it is discussion and responses to things that we've asked. Well, I do not see questions. It looks like more responses. 

### **Question:**

Okay, Is Universe going to offer a borrow against your NFT feature? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** No, we are not. But maybe we can integrate something like that. We can use someone else's API and plug it into our interface if someone else wants to. But we weren't going to build a borrowing platform for NFTs. 

### **Question:**

Okay, When is the Android and Apple App? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Just so you know, we were going to build an app, and we stopped. We decided it was not worth the time, effort, or money. The reason is because if you see the OpenSeas app, it's just a view-only app. It's not going to drive sales. There are rules that you can't sell things in crypto on the Apple Marketplace. They have all these weird laws, and you're violating the rights to their contract agreement and all this stuff. Gnosis Safe got into a legal suit with them, and it seemed like more of a headache to try and build this thing.

That's partially why OpenSea is just view only. So right now, we're staying away from it. But if things change with Apple, which I don't see happening unless they want to allow more crypto adoption, I think it would help with apps. Still, it's more of a barrier to entry because of our industry to build an app that functions the way we would want to build it.

**Algy:** Hypothetically, though, we could create an app to display cool stuff for you guys that pull you to a browser on your phone if you did want to buy something. I'm just saying, hypothetically, not saying we're already creating that.

**Mark:** That might be alpha, but what would I know? Okay. Too much overhead to keep it up to date with all the devices and no functionality. I mean, dude, it's not about that. Honestly, I probably shouldn't have said the money because I don't think it would be that crazy of a bill because maybe it would. A view-only app is going to be much cheaper to build than a fully functioning app. The US on the team, we had discussed this. We were going to build an app. We had apps in the Slack channel, and we were going to build it, and we just, at one point, we were trying to figure out the legal stuff. And we were like, this is too much of jumping through Hoops to figure this out. And then, if we do somehow figure it out, Apple could just shut us down at any minute. So it was not so much more any type of up running costs. It was just more, Where do we need to focus? And is this a priority? Is this going to drive Universe?

We don't see the OpenSea app as such a great innovation that it sent OpenSea soaring. We didn't think that it was worth our time and effort. If the community wants an app that's view only, we can vote for it, and we'll get it built. It's up to the community for everything. We can decide on anything together. So I think that's the power of the DAO and the OS app I use to check floors. I guess that it is worth it as a consumer use case that if it helps, we'll look into it again. If the community wants it, we can talk about it. I'm all for it. It's just that we decided we didn't think it was necessary.

**Algy:** There probably won't ever be an app for the Marketplace. I'm not going to leak alpha; all I'm saying is that I'm personally in favour of an app release. But it definitely won't be one where you can buy NFTs on it. And it won't be like the OpenSea one either, where it's just a fork of our Marketplace. If we were to release an app, it would provide insight.

Having your wallet on your phone, that is that's a security risk? So us releasing an app insinuates that you should have your wallet on your phone is us trying to tell people that they should set their wallet up to be at risk. So it's better for these apps on their phone to be viewed only because you're not putting your wallet at risk. Even if it did route you to MetaMask to buy it, it didn't happen on the app. Hypothetically, we're still insinuating that you should have your wallet on your phone, which is bad advice. So you guys are doing transactions on the computer. 

**Tyler:** Silo is an app, and they'll probably integrate into Universe. The truth is anyone on this call who can build something could probably legitimately raise VC funding and build an application and take a finder's fee by plugging into Universe if you all want real alpha. If I didn't have so much else on my plate, if I was going to start a company, I'd probably do that and have that application be a wallet that could plug in the Universe.

### **Question:**

Pg; your question; Will XYZ Marketplace be crypto-only, or are there plans to integrate credit cards, PayPal, other legacy types of payments or is this a regulatory headache for now? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We're not a company, and we can't accept US dollars. A few businesses were set up around Universe that maybe we could potentially explore those options. Still, Universe XYZ DAO is not going to be accepting any US dollar payment. We'll accept USDC and DAI crypto forms of the US dollar. But us being a United States company or not being a United States company.

**Tyler:** Some things are working on that.

**Mark:** Some people are working on that, though, and we have some plans of ways that we might be able to do it, but Universe will not be. But we may be able to set something up so that we can offer that, but it won't be Universe XYZ DAO accepting the money. 

### **Question:**

Okay, we answered this; Besides XYZ, Eth and Weth, what other currencies will be used.

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** You also have USDC and DAI as currencies that will be used. 

### **Question:**

A view-only app means more work updating for team...  if uni Marketplace works well with browsers and continues to, then why? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I don't think anyone's too worried about the app, but we'll talk about it as a community. 

### **Question:**

What's the fee? How is the fee decided?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Then 1.69% is the fee for the Marketplace. We decided that because what better to do when you build a dope-a-- Marketplace and just put a cherry on top? That's a meme and just put a little 69. We were going to do 69420, but we wanted to make it simple.

**Tyler:** As the finders fee.

**Mark:** I think the finders fee comes up. Tyler said it's all good. 

### **Question:**

What is the vesting schedule for the remaining tokens? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think it's 104 weeks, and we're in week 30. It hasn't even been a year. We'll say 30 something. Off the top of our head is what week we're in out of like 100-104. I don't think there's any incentive for using XYZ as a currency. We just wanted to make it an option because it's our token. Does anybody have any other questions? I think we have gotten to the end of our list. 

### **Quesiton:**

When decentralization video?

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I'll talk to Ivan, and we'll see if we can get that cranked out in the next few weeks. And Zach and I will work on all that copy and get our Founders to review it and make sure everything is to T, and we will get that out to you guys.

### **Question:**

I have a question for someone. This lindy person asked something that I didn't understand. Access points to the wallet, Zapper, Rainbow Wallet, etc. All that. 

#### **Answer:**

**Algy:** We're on Zapper already. I'm not saying that that's answering your question, but I'm wondering what is your vision for integration with Zapper or Rainbow Wallet? 

**Mark:** I know what he's asking. So let me just answer this. Genie and Gem are about to integrate with us. And I was at a party a few weeks ago, and I met some of the OpenSea guys, and I even mentioned to them we'll give anybody a founder's fee if they plug into our liquidity. The OpenSea guys seem interested in plugging into our liquidity and bringing more listings to their Marketplace. That's not a set in stone thing. But we are having those conversations with other Marketplaces and other three teams like Gem and Genie. So that founder's fee is super powerful, and that comes out of the Universe fee, that comes out of our pocket, not anyone else's. But we think that's going to drive much liquidity. If OpenSea was to plug into our protocol and they have a listing or sell one of our listings, we both would make something from that. That needs to be the angle is anybody can plug into the Universe. I don't see why they wouldn't want to.

**Algy:** Yes. I guess what I was wondering is; What would Zapper do? You go on Zapper, and you can trade your NFTs on Zapper.

**Mark:** You're saying you could build a front end that you could build an NFTs version of Zapper that plugs into universal liquidity. You can build your own Marketplace for your own NFT project and list it through the Universe protocol contracts, and it's going to get listed on Universe. Then if OpenSea is plugged into that contract, too, it'll get listed on OpenSea. So that's the power of the protocol is, listed in one place, and it gets listed everywhere. In sales, most people are; you need all points of contact. What if you list 1 NFT on 1 Marketplace protocol, and it lists it on 6 Marketplaces? It doesn't matter where that NFTs get sold if it's getting sold on Universe's contracts. That's what we built. We didn't just build a Marketplace like OpenSea, and we are going to give all those docs out; we have them published. I don't think they're published, but we'll push published soon, and anyone will have those APIs. If you guys have any projects that you all want to plug into the liquidity, you can reach out to Ryan and me, and we can try to get you guys some of those endpoints.

### **Question:**

Will there be rarity charts for all collections or just universe collections?

#### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** We should give a grant to the first project that builds and opens sources and documents, launching a custom Marketplace Universe. We should give a grant in XYZ, the first project.

**Algy:** I think that makes sense, Tyler. Tyler says we don't vote on it, but that's a good idea.

### **Question:**

How will you decide which NFTs show on the home screen? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** All right, this is something that we have not decided on as a team.

**Algy:** It's going to be community-based. The decision is a way that's not exploitable. We need to make sure we come up with a way that isn't exploitable, where people can take advantage of the system that we set up for it and get past people who deserve organic promotion and stuff. We don't want it to be where we're just cherry-picking the projects that we just bought and pumping our bags. We want it to be fair.

**Mark:** We don't want another Nate situation where people will be like you guys were picking NFTs. We'll just openly let the community decide which ones, and then no one will front-run anyone because it'll just be public information in the Discord or whatever, where people are like, oh, we're going to add this one. Let's add this one. Then everyone agrees. 

### **Question:**

Then your next question about; How projects will be verified? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We're honestly not going to verify projects. We're going to start letting people. Hopefully, they're not. Nick, stop, bro. We're not verifying the projects. You're going to have to verify the contract address. We will not verify anyone in the first few months of this. If the community wants us to start verifying projects, we will vote. But we had this conversation before. We don't want to play favouritism. Also, we think that people need to be verifying contracts you want to verify a collection, check the chain because that's the safest and best way to do it. Learn how to read Etherscan and find a valid contract, and verify. You go into the Board Ape Discord. They have that contract address pinned.

I don't care if an NFT collection is verified on OpenSea. You should still be going and checking the chain and making sure that that's not a fake verification badge. A front end is easily exploitable. We've talked about this, and it might not be people's favourite answer that we're not going to verify this, and we might sound like crazy people, but that's how you verify an NFT by the contract address.

**Algy:** Yeah, but eventually, Mark is probably right; at first, there won't be a system. And what Nick tried to bring up just now is something about that product that we keep leaking the name of and don't explain. And it was Temple. We have ideas for this voting process, and that's not what Temple is. It was just something that we talked about through that. But we have this idea for this voting process that happens fully on a snapshot. I'm going to explain it. Anyone who holds XYZ will be able to make a proposal to get a collection verified. Then anybody who has XYZ can vote to get it to verify that collection. If it passes a quorum, it gets verified. This is the best community-based method we've come up with so far that can't be exploited. But yeah, as Mark said, we probably won't release anything until we know that it actually can't be exploited. And it actually will work. Right, because it's hard to test stuff like this without trial and error. And we don't want you guys to be guinea pigs.

We want to make sure whatever we put out for this verification because that's a big topic in any social media or entertainment anywhere. After all, NTS is entertainment. So at this point, we need to make sure we're not even going to use a checkmark badge because it doesn't fit our aura or brand or anything. If we do verification, it will be community-based, and it can't be exploitable. We're not going to be saying, Mark and I decided we're going to verify this project today. That's not happening. It has to be on-chain, in some aspect or retrievable somehow.

**Mark:** If you all want to verify collections, we can. I'm just saying I'm not the one who will do it. Our team is not showing favouritism to any collections. We're not verifying FLUFs; we're not verifying ASM brains. It's just that we're not getting into this situation.

**Add Speaker:** For now. We do advise, like Mark said, that always check on-chain, double-check the project's social media pages and websites to find their actual contract address and double-check on Etherscan and Universe. It's the right contract address because people will be minting. They're going to have free reign to mint on our platform. And once they mint, our scraper will pick up those NFTs immediately. So those will be the ones showing up on the University Marketplace. Just always double-check. We're going to be trying our best. We have a report button. If you see fake pages and fake NFTs, you can report them, and we'll take them down because we don't want fake.

**Mark:**  But the thing is, How do you make it decentralized? And you got to think about like this is part of why we're not starting with verification is because we have absolutely no way to truly decentralize it with us just figuring out how it works. We need to figure it out as a community. And that was my point. It's like we aren't going to have verification. People will have to check the chain, and we'll figure it out as a community.

**Algy:** Well, the strategy, we only had XYZ holders voting and creating proposals that are not exploitable, but that one works. We don't want to make that the way we do it. Then ten days later, we realized there was a better way. So yeah, it's like our Marketplace. We don't want to just release anything off of our first impression, thinking that we came up with the best idea because that will happen in the community. I know people who were excited about this one FLUF drop, and I'm not going to change, and that it happened. But then it happened, and then everybody was you guys did that wrong. And it was the same people saying we did it wrong where the same people saying right before that was the way we should do it, and they were excited. So I feel like we're trying to plan where we don't all agree, even though the community agrees. And then ten days later, we're all like, that wasn't the best way to do it. We should have done this. We want to avoid that in every situation when we release anything because that can happen.

Everyone is saying community verification is great. Gunner pointed it out. It can't be bootable. I think the way that we have come up with is not bootable but is it fair? I don't know if it's fair to make everybody hold one token to vote, but maybe it is. So we just got to consider it more. I think of what Mark is saying about the whole contract address. Eventually, we will have to have a way to make it easier for people to know what's legit and what's not. Since anyone's going to be

**Mark:** The way it's legit is the contract address of the collection.

**Algy:** Yes, I've been on these AMAs recently. It's been at least a month now. But Ledger was hosting AMAs repetitively in the last month, and it was because people were Bored Ape kept getting scammed and what they would say over and over. One of the kids even knew the contract address by heart, so they would say you need to be verifying his contract address. It's so easy to know you're not getting scammed in NFTs if you just look at the contract address. One of the Ledger Founders doesn't own a Board Ape and knows the contract address by heart because he's had to help so many people who got scammed and didn't even realize this. So I think that Mark's 100% right, that it's just such an easy thing for people to know. Crypto's whole point if you have the people developing hardware wallets even saying it. You're supposed to be understanding how Etherscan works and see how the contract is addressed. I think Etherscan, personally, though, could do a better job too. In MetaMask. What if when you went to buy a Board Ape, MetaMask and Etherscan were like had a name like this is the real Board Ape collection.

Maybe even showed its volume on one of the websites. There are so many ways that MetaMask themselves could upgrade the UI. Ledger is something they're prioritizing. They want to make it so that the UI for new users explains stuff to where you don't even need it to be verified on OpenSea because on MetaMask and the transaction, it's telling you this contract address is this item. So I think that one of the biggest things is that we're going to have verification, and it will be community-driven. We're not going to rush into it. But Mark's right. Overall, we do need people to learn what a contract address is. And if you're saying that the community is not smart enough to do that, that's what's not good. You guys are saying it's not good that we don't have verification right away. But what's not good is that the community is so open to getting scammed. People need to learn more.

**Add Speaker:** That's what's not happening. That people are so willing to jump into this without learning. People need not do that as much. It makes it hard for me to recommend crypto to people and stuff because I'm always afraid until we get past this where you recommend crypto to your friend, and then there's a chance of getting scammed, which is happening not because of OpenSea. It's happening because MetaMask does not have a good interface that explains to people what the transaction they're signing is. In my opinion, that's like the biggest cause of it. Until there are upgrades on that end, I don't think that there's any chance that it even will matter. People will still get scammed whether we have a check or not, the same way because they don't know that they can look at a number on Etherscan and see it's the right one.

**Mark:** You are trying to ask something. 

**Community Member:** I was going to ask, where can we put feature requests? I guess not the Marketplace feature. I guess it is a Marketplace feature request for verification. Where can we push something to go ahead and propose a difference. Thank you. I'll go ahead and put something up.

**Mark:** Thank you, sir. We appreciate you.

**Algy:** Do you know what this person just said? He said that he doesn't know how to check the contract address just because you're saying that I'm going to start annoying our team and that we should make a video that explains how to check the contract address. I'm going to annoy our team until they make that video because that's huge. People need to know how to check that. Do you know what I'm saying?

It could be a five-second video because

**Mark:** I didn't mean to sound like a Dick when I was like, yeah, people are going to f---ing have to learn this s--t.

**Algy:** We want to help them learn. 

**Mark:** I walk in front of people, and they ask me, what do you think the NFT space needs? And I say, I think we need more education. This is financial technology. People have been building in DeFi. Many of us learn how to use DeFi, but we're talking about Artists, and they may not understand what is happening here. We should be educating people on how to protect their assets and that if you just click on a file, your assets are at risk and then it sucks. I heard someone say a few weeks ago; that it's like getting robbed in cryptos. Your baptism in crypto, it's like, dude, that's f---ing bulls--t. This happens to everyone. I've never been hacked. I feel really bad for people who get hacked, but at the same time, you got to learn how to do this. It sucks that you have to get burned to learn. But it shouldn't be that way. It really shouldn't. We should be trying to educate people on this. Tim has ideas on how we educate people in this space. I have ideas, but we can't educate everybody.

And that's the thing that sucks, is we have to lean on each other. But checking the contract address shouldn't be this huge thing. That should just be something that we do, even if it's verified. If you go to OpenSea, you should still be checking that s--t just in case someone was able to hack their front end and make it look like this was a verified collection and people were buying Board Apes or something. It's not that hard to hack a front end. It depends on which front end, I guess. But I wasn't trying to be a dick when I said that. I just said I don't think it's a lot to ask for people to verify. Go to an extra link and verify on Etherscan. But maybe I'm being inconsiderate.

**Community Member:** There's a really good feature that comes with or at least makes it easy if you go ahead and get a grid plus wallet. Suppose you get a grid plus wallet. It lays out exactly what you're interacting with. And then you can go ahead and highlight it. Then you can just check to make sure on either scan that's the exact one you're interacting with.

**Algy:** We're going to have it on our Marketplace, so when you're viewing your NFTs or Collections, there is an easy way to navigate without hitting any extra buttons to get to the contract address on our testing. I know some of you guys are testing on our testing. This isn't set up fully yet. It is on the page end, but we still need to update the actual viewing when you hit my NFTs. But we're going to make it so that when you look at your NFT, you're showing information about the collection, the owner, and the contract address. And this information about the contract address is what people need to start learning about the collections they collect. There are a million different ways. It will be so easy to verify that on Universe. I'm going to get them to make a video on how to find that on etherscan. There needs to be way more educational content released on every project in that ledger competition. As soon as those videos are on Universe, I will show the video that won in our Universe announcements and tell everybody to watch it because it's such good information on how to stay safe in crypto.

**Mark:** We can make educational videos. We're going to wrap this up. This is 1.5 hrs, and we really shouldn't be doing these AMAs for this long because people stop watching them on YouTube. And no one wants to listen to these when they're this long, so we're going to end this, but you guys had a lot of good questions today. Let me just make sure there are no other super good questions. These are just kinds of people arguing with me. I feel like.

Dude, if people aren't checking the chain in 10 years, I don't know. We've lost all hope for humanity at this point; the Board Apes will still be losing their seed phrases. Rock, get some sleep.

**Algy:** Good ðŸ’©.
