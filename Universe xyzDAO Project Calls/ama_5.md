## Intro

**Mark:** Okay. I think we have everybody. 

I can't hear Chuba, though.

**Ryan:** I'm here. What's up, guys?

**Mark:** Yeah, what's up, Chuba? We were just waiting for you because I knew that you wanted to give some of the Development Updates. We can go ahead and get started. I will be working off the agenda that I sent you, Chuba. 

We will go ahead and just start with Minting Auctions and Marketplace Updates. I'll say off the last AMA; we mentioned that we're postponing the options so that we can prioritize the marketplace. I'll let you get into some of the updates details, and stuff we've worked on this week. 

But as Tyler's been saying, it looks like we're focused on a **March 5 launch date**, which is under 3 weeks away. So a lot of very exciting things to look forward to on the marketplace. But I'll let Chuba take it away on a more specific development. üëá

## Development Updates [[01:22]](https://youtu.be/hJde3E-fuB4?t=82) üß∞

**Ryan:** So I can talk a little bit more level. But, I can't get too specific. The scraper is up and running, and our Devs have been hooking that up to the marketplace. Lots of improvements on the scrapper. We've been making many back-end improvements and the front-end integration to wrap everything nicely. Then starting end of this week, next week, there will be much testing. So I'm sure a handful of community members will get some DMs from us to hop on and help us test out. But Mark, I mean, I can't go into too much detail about exactly what.

**Mark:** Yeah, you don't have too, just general stuff.

We don't need massive details. 

**Ryan:** I mean, I can say that we have things like 'buy it now' working. We have offers‚Äî that just got tidied up. Most of the things you would expect from a marketplace, somethings I've had to push off to future releases. But we're doing our best to get this shipped on March 5.

**Mark:** Okay, sweet. I appreciate the updates. We are working on several things. We have been doing these calls weekly, so we don't have as many updates.

## Minting Auctions and Marketplace Updates [[02:43]](https://youtu.be/hJde3E-fuB4?t=163) üñº üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

**Tyler:** The update is that we had a call with our entire team, [Lime Chain](https://twitter.com/LimeChainHQ) and [George](https://twitter.com/GSpasov). 

George is helping a lot, and Lime Chain is a massive team. George is helping as the Lime Chain and Enter DAO leader to help the Project Manager with this launch and ensure that we hit deadlines, and the deadlines are very soon. We're going for a soft launch on March 5. Suppose we can pull it off. If it ends up being a week later than that, it's still not going to be very long, and it's not going to be April 1. We're busting our butts to get it out, and so when you're in the middle of a sprint launching something, there are features that you pull out during the process. Once we release it, we're going to start shipping in 2 week sprint times, which we haven't been able to implement up to this point because we haven't had a live product. The first couple of sprints will probably be adding features that we've already 80% built, and then there will also be things that we essentially work on and push out.

> The first couple of sprints will be shipping things we already have. 

We thought that we would be able to launch the marketplace earlier. The new minting contracts are on top of the minting contracts we have already and auctions all in this time frame. Naturally, auctions got relegated or deprioritized. That doesn't mean that we're not going to launch auctions like the code's 90% done. On top of that, there are marketplace features that will come in in later sprints that are already built. One example is the Search Feature. We need people to be able to search collection, but we have a much more advanced scope built out for all the things that you're going to be able to search. That's probably not going to be there at launch. We just need to be able to search collections at launch. We will immediately launch something here that is a beta product. It's going to get better and better in an ongoing capacity. When I say it's a beta product, I'm not suggesting that it's not going to be good. We're proud of what we built, and we will stand by it.

But many of the first iterations and sprints will be improvements that we've already mapped out and built. So we pretty much had one of the better calls that I think we've ever had this morning, and that call was pretty much confirming that we do believe we'd be able to hit these deadlines. Now, if we don't, it's still software. Things can come up. We can realize that something is there, and we need to delay. So don't hold a gun to your head. But, it's coming, and quickly. And I think what we built is awesome. So I would say that while we don't have the updates you want, we've been heads down busting our butts, making sure that we hit these deadlines.

A lot of the team hasn't slept. Sterios in Bulgaria has been doing 16 hr hour workdays.

**Mark:** Our entire team on the development side has been hustling and trying to get this all out, but I think Tyler has given us the best expample that we could provide. But realistically, that's most of what we have for updates for everybody. The marketplace is coming soon, and we'll be reiterating and dropping many features afterwards that we just couldn't cram into this launch. But we will have a ton of new features. 

We will add on to some of those filtering features, and we'll just keep adding stuff as the community asked us to add things and brings proposals. But we have much stuff finished. 

As Tyler said, we couldn't squeeze it all in because we didn't want good to be the enemy of great. üß†

**Tyler:** We can list the things that are finished, but they're not going to be in this launch. 

* Auction platform üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è
  * It's pretty much done, but we can't prioritize that right now. 
* Advanced search features üîç
  * Comes after marketplace
* The Polymorph battle game was audited in November ü§° ‚öîÔ∏è ü§°
  * We built the front-end
  * Comes after marketplace 
* 3D Polymorphs ü¶π
* Deviants üëπ
* Metaverse ‚ò¢Ô∏è
  * In progress.

None of that's coming until after we have the marketplace. I'm not sure that any of those will be in the first two sprints that come after the marketplace launch because, realistically, we're going to those weeks to iterate.

We will need to figure out what we need to build and what we need to fix in that time frame. And I don't know when those things are going to be reprioritized. Ultimately, we built the best decentralized marketplace that the industry will have ever seen up to this point. That's our kind of beachhead flagship thing. We read everybody's tweets responding to us, and if we tweet about anything but the marketplace, people ask us to launch the marketplace. We're doing what the community is asking us. We likely need to be focused on that directly afterwards. 

Does the entire team need to be full-fledged heads down focused only on the marketplace after launch? Probably not. 

So, we probably are going to be able to fit some of those things into the sprints, but we don't know what we don't know right now, and we need to get it out, and we get people using it. Then we need to fix things about it, and whatever people think is wrong with it. 

I think that that's the generalized plan and expectation people should have.

Although, we've built many things that are pretty much ready to go. But I think everyone on this call would agree that we need to focus on the marketplace right now. That's what everyone's excited about, an unofficial deadline. I don't know 100% that it will launch on that date. That's what we're internally shooting for. If it gets pushed out another week. It's still very close to where it's not that far out. ü§û

**Mark:** So we can go ahead and start opening this up to the AMA section where we all ask questions. 

I'll jump into the Pre AMA Channel. 

If anybody has any questions and you'd like to come up and talk or ask a question, please feel free.

## Pre AMA Questions ?

**Ryan:** I see one question. 

### **Question:**

Is there a risk to rolling out an incomplete product that people may drop by, check it out, not love it, and not come back?

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** It's not incomplete in that respect. I mean, you may all think it's incomplete. You don't know how much extra stuff we built. We're just not releasing everything we built as features because otherwise, it will never release.

**Mark:** It's a complete product.

**Algy:** Technically, Nifty Gateway and OpenSea are incomplete products, right?

**Mark:** Yeah. There are always new features coming out. And while we've been building this the ecosystem has evolved.

**Algy:** NBA TOPSHOT still says beta when you go on their website, and they've been out for almost 2 years‚Äî or longer?

**Tyler:** I mean, we're talking about semantics. From an agile coding perspective, every product in the world is an incomplete product. 

We should always strive to get marginally better every sprint. (2 weeks) And that compounds over time. If you get 2% better every 2 weeks sprint, those numbers get very big after multiple months of iterating. We're not releasing a B squad product. I think that our back-end will outperform OpenSea. I believe that we're releasing a product that will drastically outperform LooksRare. And the X2Y2 thing that is out there. I think we're releasing a better product than Nifty Gateway. So I don't think we're a B squad product. But we built a ton of features that's not going to be in there intitially.

**Mark:** As Tyler said, nothing is a finished product. Especially software. There will always be new tools, new features, new things that you can add on to, and you can't let good be the enemy of great.

**Tyler:** Like if we try to strive for perfection we will never attain it. 

**Mark:** Especially in an industry that moves so fast-paced. We built this marketplace while watching everybody critique and ridicule OpenSea. So while we watch feature requests get asked for by artists, we added them. But the industry just moved so quickly, and there are so many requests that we can't build a product and fit it all in because tomorrow, there will be new requests. If we waited for tomorrow's request, as Tyler said, we're going to release a product in ten years. So the best thing to do is release. Then we're going to build on top of what we have and continue to connect and upgrade the Smart Contracts. All of our contracts are completely secure. We've been getting them audited for months. I think we've gone through 3 or 4 rounds of audited products.

**Tyler:** Yeah. And we're also probably being a little self-critical. You guys might not know this. 

**Mark:** We've been building on this marketplace for a year, so there are many things that we wish we could squeeze into the first round, but we see we're thinking long term, and we just said we couldn't put it all in in the first iteration, but we will be vigilantly working towards adding upgrades. And when the community requests something through the DAO, we will be working towards getting those feature requests added ASAP. 

All right, Chuba, where was the next or is there another next question? That was a pretty good question.

**Ryan:** Yeah. 

### **Question:**

Where can the community go to make suggestions once the marketplace is launched?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Okay. Yeah. So that's a perfect question.

**Algy:** Governance Channel. The one place is our governance channel in discord.

**Mark:** Okay. We have a system set up, so the governance forum is excellent to discuss. But if you're looking for actual feature requests, we're going to try and funnel these as easily as possible is to doing it through our Support Desk. 

## Support Server [[14:15]](https://youtu.be/hJde3E-fuB4?t=855) ‚òéÔ∏è 

We have a separate Discord Server, and we can have Rayne come up and talk about it if he wants to. But we're going to have feature requests be submitted via Support Tickets. This allows us to get through them and silo all the information into one place so that our developers can go to them and access all this information. We've already had a few requests, but we couldn't add anything yet. But we will use the Support Channel to add feature requests to the front-end. 

So we'll let Rayne talk a bit of this if he wants to. 

**Rayne:** Yeah. So essentially, we designed a private server so that people can easily access support and a team designed specifically to take care of any issues that may arise, we can prioritize whatever issues might be happening appearing. 

Eventually, I suspect that we can design it to handle marketing and promotional queries‚Äî and then the feature requests, as you say. I think the feature requests will be easy because many people will likely ask for the same thing. So if we have many Support Tickets or queries for the same thing, it's going to make it easier to iterate.

> [Click here to get to the support server](https://discord.gg/TJG5rm8JnH)

**Mark:** Yeah. And it's just going to avoid some of the chaos and stuff getting lost. I was one of those people that would go into OpenSea Support and try to talk to people, and then comments gets lost. 

I've seen amazing requests from the community on many of our different channels. Some of that stuff gets lost. So the reason we decided to go with the support server to set this up is so that we could funnel all this into one place so that we're not losing it because we think everyone's opinion here matters. 

We're on the route to being a community-led protocol, and that's something we strive to be. As many feature requests as people ask for that are feasible, we will try and facilitate that. Also, we do want to do one thing, and I'm not sure if we said this publicly, but we do want to try to integrate with as many collections as possible. For instance, Enter DAO they have the Sharded Minds Collection, and they have built a utility for the decentraland plots where you can rent out your decentraland plots on Enter DAO.

But we'd like to build a front-end UI on Universe that makes that easier but still plugs into Enter DAO. We're not going to be able to add all of the feature requests for collections, but definitely ones in the top 200 that have cool utility or something. Maybe you can stake in NFT. We want to add those front-end features to make our marketplace a little more user-friendly for people who own or take part in those collections. But we are still a way out from that because we do have to deploy. But we want to work with collections and offer as much help as possible towards creating utility and making just easier UI for collections. So you don't have to leave Universe to do certain things.

### **Question:**

What will happen after 50 million DAO rewards are done? Perhaps incentivize community engagement by increasing DAO rewards? 

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** What I would say is to check out Forum.Universe.XYZ. There's some good discussion related to incentivizing the way that will be useful to the marketplace and the community as a whole. But outside of that, I don't know if there's much more information I can provide.

**Mark:** I mean, I can just add on. I believe what happened with BarnBridge when the 50 million DAO incentivization stopped. I think they restrapped and added more tokens to the liquidity from the treasury. It depends.

I don't know. I can't answer that because we don't have a plan. But I do know that the Barnbridge team did end up figuring that out.

**Fluffer Nutter:** It went to the DAO, and then the DAO voted to use the fees accrued through the Smart Alpha or all the smart products, and the DAO voted to buy more. And I would assume that was what would happen here. I would assume it'd be very similar, but most likely, it would all be done through the DAO.

**Mark:** Yes, the DAO will have control over any of this, and whatever the community decides to do, the DAO will execute it, and the team will follow up and make sure that it goes according to plan. ü§ù

**Algy:** What was the one question I think we skipped over the one that was? 

I believe that the simple answer to the question about exchanges is that the team can't create new liquidity pools, or we can, but we're not going to. And so that's up to the community. If they wanted a new liquidity pool in a spot, they would have to create that themselves.

**Mark:** Wait, where do you see this question?

**Algy:** What was the question? Ryan?

**Ryan:** It was bundled in with the last one.

### Question:

Are there plans to have Universe listed on exchanges? (Centralized exchanges)

### Answer:

**Mark:** The way that centralized exchange listings go. They're a little bit more difficult to arrange. We will work with exchanges if they want to work with us. So far, we've worked with the ones that have reached out to us through trusted partners. But if you're referring to like Coinbase or something, we haven't, and we're not in talks with Coinbase.

**Troy:** They all run their own NFT platforms.

**Mark:** Troy, you're a little bit low.

**Troy:** I was saying it's a little different when they all run their own NFT marketplaces.

**Mark:** Yeah, for sure.

**Algy:** Coinbase has to be okay with having them on there, and it might not be true. 

**Mark:** And Coinbase is building a marketplace, so who knows?

**Algy:** Yeah. üëç

**Mark:** We will try our best to get on as many centralized exchanges that are going to work with us. But like Troy said, I think many centralized exchanges are very interested in NFT marketplaces and building their own. So it's a little bit harder.

**Algy:** They may see Universe as competition and maybe not want people to learn about it because of how we're super decenrralized and trying to move everything towards that.

**Mark:** Yeah, I think that's the best answer that we can give. But yes, we are trying to get listed, and we are working towards that. But it is a little bit harder than just getting a DeFi token listed. 

### **Question: JD Buffalo**

Do you guys think Polymorphs are going to make it? 

### **Answer:**

Fluffer Nutter said it best. Polymorphs? Gonna to make it. **PGMI**

We love the polymorphs.

**Community Member:** Why would you ask this question?

**Mark:** Yeah, for real. üòÜ

**Algy:** PGMI. You have to say it, PGMI, PGMI. Whoever asked that question, we need you to drop a PGMI so that we know that you believe‚Äî JD Buffalo has a nice goldtooth pic.

**Mark:** So I think he's a believer in the Polys. Yeah. Tyler goes; I think he just wanted to hear us say it.

**Algy:** He's repping the Morph Avatar.

### **Question:**

Are there any benefits to having the POAPS?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I would say yes. üòâ

We don't have any plans as of right now to do anything with the POAPs. But POAPs are a badge of honour. It would be safe to say that we like to reward our early supporters. So we don't have any plans as of right now. But I think that if there's anything that we do. We tend to give

**Algy:** It's a good way to get your wallet address on our list.

**Mark:** That's a great way to put it.

**Algy:** I don't know if this is right or not. Transmental, do we have a POAP for this AMA?

**Zach:** Yeah, we do.

**Algy:** Okay.

**Mark:** He wants to share the code. 

### **Question:**

So, are you guys leveraging any VC partnerships, relationships, things, or anything else? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** There's much stuff we can't talk about, but the answer is yes. This FLUF World expansion and many of these other partners that we have aligned with are what we're building. I mean, I can let Tyler take it away.

**Tyler:** All the prominent VCs in the industry have reached out to us. We do OTC deals to extend the runway with private partners. [The Blockchain Capital](https://twitter.com/blockchaincap) has quite a bit, and we work with [Aleks Larsen](https://twitter.com/aIekslarsen) a lot, [True Ventures](https://twitter.com/trueventures) and [Adam D'Augelli](https://twitter.com/adaugelli). I don't know exactly how to say his last name. Adam, I know you're probably listening to this, and [Kevin Rose](https://twitter.com/kevinrose) have been huge helpers. I think our friends at [Fourth Revolution Capital](https://twitter.com/4RCapital) will support things we're doing. I talked with [Vance](https://twitter.com/pythianism) from [Framework](https://twitter.com/hiFramework) a lot, and interested in working with us. 

We don't have any more OTC to do, though. We're well funded and happy with where we are right now. I have had; I would say, ten different capital partners reach out to see if they could do it. I'm telling everyone‚Äî you have to buy it off-market if you want XYZ right now. 

So I don't want to say anything without it sounding; this is tricky when talking about price and buying the token. I'm not encouraged to do that. I'm just telling them how they would do it at this point because we're in a good spot.

We have years of runway, and I'm proud of what we built. If we find a need to raise capital to scale or iterate faster, OpenSea just raised $100M. (1.5B valutation) 

If it comes up that we are in a spot where we need to start doing that, I think we can depend on our capital partners and a lot of the capital partners we have are exceptional‚Äî I worked with them through Barnbridge, and they acted ethically. We are not currently asking for their help to do anything other than be active members. I think all of these AMAs offer help, give advice, and ultimately that's what you want. I'm very happy with what we are working with. More people want to work with us and are excited about it. Over time, we'll continue to build inroads into those groups. But many people are excited about what we're making, and I think we all should learn from them in ways because they got where they are by being smart, successful, business people.

### **Question: Fluffer Nutter**

What if we would incentivize people to buy NFTs instead of listing? Because, to be honest, I don't want to sell any of my NFTs. I want to buy yours.

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** I mean, is that a question? Yeah.

**Mark:** He's saying, why don't we incentivize people to buy instead of incentivizing people to list? So if you bought an NFT on the platform, you'd get the reward instead of a listing.

**Tyler:** That's a tricky question. Part of it is because incentivizing buy can create wash trading, ultimately what we need to do. I hear your situation, and that's cool, but I think it's a slippery slope to incentivize buying things on our platform, but it extrapolates the sketchiness. The reason that listings are so important is because of what OpenSeas's current moat is right now. Where they have a monopoly on the industry is that, unlike Uniswap. If you built this decentralandized liquidity layer, you could ask six LPs that 10 capital groups provide most of the liquidity and DeFi, since their ERC 20s get those 10 capital groups to move Sushi. Then you've ported over a meaningful moat of capital into another decentralandized AMM. NFTs are very different for many people; hundreds of thousands of different wallets have listed NFTs on OpenSea. Well, it's not going to be easy to get all of those people over. That is the number one hardest thing that's going to determine whether or not Universe is successful. 

It's that John Travolta meme, that he's just walking in and he looks around, and there's like nobody there. üëá

![giphy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99563566/165005019-cafb2f91-c9d2-448d-b892-006117300ede.gif)

You can't have that as a marketplace. So we want people to buy NFTs on our platform because they like the NFT, not because we've incentivized them to buy them. But we need many people listings over, or the experience will be bunk, and there isn't going to be anything to buy there. So our incentive that we're trying to push for is listings because of that reason. If you don't want to sell any of your NFTs, don't sell any. But we do need listings on the platform. 

The number one thing everyone listening to this call can do is strive for the success of Universe at launch is list all of your NFTs on our platform out of the gate. But I know people aren't going to do that, and I'm not going to do enough. There are FLUFs I have that I'm never going to sell. I probably won't list a single one of my Polymorphs. Anything that I have listed on OpenSea will get listed on Universe. So any of you that have NFTs listed on OpenSea. It will very much help us if you move them. That's the number one thing you can do as DAO patron member out of the gate, and I wouldn't even stop there.

I'd get your friends, get all your homeboys and homegirls to list their NFTs on Universe because that 100% is what is going to move the needle. 

We cannot control that outside of incentivizing. That's up to thousands of people in our Discord and ecosystem to get all their friends. And if all of you get 5 people to do that, then Universe will be successful.

**Nick:** Any of my NFTs are getting listed for a ridiculous price. I'm going to list all my NFTs. If you buy them, thank you very much.

**Algy:** There you go, buy Nicks's NFTs.

**Fluffer Nutter:** I will list the NFTs on Universe that I have on Opensea instead. 

I guess I didn't have enough time to type everything. But I think just the general atmosphere and the NFT space right now is that there have been all these new marketplaces that come out, and I think at this point, people are hesitant. But people also know about Universe and know it's been getting built a long time. 

At this exact moment, I wonder, how do we incentivize people to list? Because if we go and tell people to list, list, list‚Äî on the Universe platform, I think people will be hesitant to do that. I mean, at a certain point.

**Add Speaker:** Tyler, it might be better if you talk on Marks MIC because you're cutting in and out.

**Mark:** No, he was. I was on mute, and he didn't know.

**Tyler:** I'll just say this quick. I think the difference is I haven't used LooksRare other than being on their site. 

I did not integrate my wallet with X2Y2, whatever the platform's name because there is a delegate call function that they could be malicious. I mean, I don't know who's building it. I'm not saying anything about their character. I just read the Smart Contracts. But I think we will be in a different situation than people in the industry who know us and trust us. So you're not operating off of this random anon thing that I'm allowing and giving permissions to. So while I hear what you're saying, I think we probably are in a situation. And I believe that the community that is listening to this call if they push all their friends to do it, this is most likely a safer situation.

**Mark:** It goes back to the same argument of what is better, organic growth or paying influencers to do something. Everyone hates the influencers. But that's how some of us look at this incentivization stuff. If you build a platform that's good enough, they will come. Our platform fees are lower than OpenSea. They're competitively lower than any other marketplace that exists. Our auction house has 0% fees. Honestly, if you're a collector, you'll want to earn more money. So that's the incentive right there. We will give you 100% if you're an artist, and there's your incentive there. And also we're going to be building a beautiful technology. Most people don't even know how decentralandized NFTs are. Universal is striving to make NFs completely decentralandized where they live on-chain forever. And I think that is enough incentive for artists to trust that their work will live forever on the blockchain and not have to worry about an OpenSea type character taking down their work because it's not something that goes with their ethos or something along those lines.

**Tyler:** Later, if we think we need incentives later, we can add them like that.

**Algy:** Also, out of the gate.

**Tyler:** Out of the gate. They didn't do incentives, and then they realized they needed a very good chance that we could launch without incentives and get market share organically. And then what do we give all these incentives away? There was no reason to do it. But you can't take incentives back. But we can launch this, let it organically happen where we're at, and then come up with a game plan to do better. So because we don't need to do it out of the gate, we can see where we're. Then I think that we let it iteratively grow and see where we're standing, and then we make a plan. Right now, we're operating off of assumptions, and no one on this question is the right way to do it. But what we do know is that we'll know more 3 weeks from now than we know right now. So when we get more data, we'll have a better picture.

**Fluffer Nutter:** Those are good. Also, let me say one more thing, and then I'll stop. While you guys were talking, I realized that you have a lot going for you. The Looks Rare team sold all of their profit. You guys are a DAO. All your money is going into the DAO. Then also, the reason that I stopped selling my NFTs is that I don't feel safe in the NFT space. What I think most people are looking for in the NFT space is a safe and secure platform that incentivizes enough. And I'm happy that nothing is being given to anyone because then I think that is even more organic. And honestly, I don't think people care about an airdrop anymore in the NFT space. They just want to operate and sell and trade their NFTs safely. I haven't sold in a month because I don't feel safe. So I appreciate your input. Thanks for letting me talk.

**Tyler:** Well, that sucks.

**Mark:** Love for Nutter. That honestly sucks for the NFT industry that you feel that way because I'm sure other people feel the same.

**Algy:** You guys got to remember that most people probably don't use Crypto and NFTs, and that number is probably over 90%. So all of us using it are ahead of the curve. Even our marketplace is taking a year of extra time to build. I still think we're way ahead of the market as far as NFTs go. There still aren't games released for these NFTs we trade; all people know about NFTs right now is trading images, and there's way more to do with NFTs than that. That's something people got to remember about the Universe. Most people don't use crypto because there's so much hate for it. People think it's a scam. If you look up on Google, crypto is it says crypto is a scam is the first thing people look at. And until this attitude towards crypto changes, which I think has to do with what Mark brought up about these influencers pumping and dumping, until that attitude towards crypto changes, I don't think we'll see the full potential of what it is. I think it will happen where it's all going to be based on more technology being built and making it more user-friendly.

You can see that Metamascardi has made attempts since this OpenSea thing to warn people more about signing stuff. As the space grows, I don't think that there's any. What I'm saying is one of the questions was, What if people don't switch over from OpenSea? I don't think that matters at all, honestly, just because most of the users that are going to be using NFTs in the future long term don't use NFTs right now.

**Mark:** Explain why it doesn't matter a very important role in the NFT space. They help onboard people the same way Coinbase does. They're a Fia on-ramp for NFT. You can buy a Board Ape with your credit card. If you have a million-dollar credit limit, you can buy an NFT with your credit card. You don't have to be a crypto savant. That's good for the industry. We need Coin bases; we need OpenSeas. But what Aly is saying is we are still just so early. When you see the whole space scale, it's not going to matter because the whole DeFi side of crypto, the whole DeFi side of finance, is expanding, but it still has so many fewer users. But over time, this is a paradigm shift in the way of thinking of why people are drawn towards Ethereum, and these Decentralandized technologies are they want to be their bank. It sucks that many people in NFTs don't understand that, and artists don't want to be their bank. So we need to focus on education for NFT people because many of them skipped over DeFi.

But you have to look at how the growth opportunity of the market. It's okay if OpenSea kept all its users; in 2 years, ten to 15 million users will be buying NFTs. Right now, there's hardly 1 million. So when you think about the growth potential of the entire network, as long as you can capture new market share, you don't have to worry so much about the old market share because there's just so much opportunity coming forward.

**Tyler:** Also, in the state where we're dropping right now, I am concerned using a lot of these platforms. That's why I looked here. I haven't used that other platform. When the Phishing attack was going on with OpenSea, they weren't 100% sure where the attack was coming from. I think that the NFT markets that come into the market continue to do well. There's a reason that Lindy effects exist in crypto networks and are so strong because people trust compound more than cream. After all, compound has been in the market longer. They had one thing that affected them negatively. At one point, funds at the protocol level weren't lost. I think people out of the gate will trust us more than us. And I believe that OpenSea has earned that. I believe when Coinbase launches a platform, people will trust that platform because Coinbase has earned that.

**Mark:** I'm going to trust that. I trust Coinbase every day to help me manage my funds. There's no reason I wouldn't trust them. They manage my NFT.

**Tyler:** But the point is that I think the more people trust the platform, and also, because of the vulnerability issues, I don't believe that it's ethical for us to encourage everybody to the platform. Day one is good to have over and move over. And then I think that we incentivize things long-term downstream. But ultimately, we are much code, and I think we need to let it roll out. We need to allow users to use the platform. And then, over time, if we need to implement incentives, we have that ability. So I think that we roll it out and let people start using it. We've audited the crap out of this, building it for a long time. I think the industry is waiting for what we made. I want users, and it sounds like other people do, too. So let's roll it out and get worried about incentives later.

**Mark:** Okay? I don't think we have any more questions, so if anyone has anymore in the Pre AMA chat.

## POAP

**Algy:** No, don't type it in the chat. Okay? You got to go to the POAP claim channel under the Universe category and follow the directions. The POAP distribution event is now active. DM me to get your POAP. DM POAP bot and poke claim under the Universe category xyzrunner, all lowercase if you want the POAP.

**Mark:** I always hate when you guys make me do this. I have to undo my DMs, and then I get a million DMs.

**Algy:** Maybe we should never mind. We'll leave it in the call this time. But next time, we will wait until we end the call and give the POAP. You're only going to get the POAP in the call.

**Mark:** What the f__k? It's not working for me, guys.

**Algy:** Or do you think it's good to leave it in the video and leave it timed for a bit after so that people in other times?

**Mark:** What's the word?

**Algy:** The word?

**Mark:** I'm getting this.

**Algy:** The word is thin mints, all lower case.

**Mark:** Thank you, Transmental, for doing the POAP art. We mess with the polymorphs.

**Algy:** Yeah, the polymorphs are the coolest thing.

## Clown Charles

**Mark:** Okay, I'm going to send a little tweet on the channel so that everyone can see it. But I want everyone to know who Clown Charles is because it was revealed today.

**Algy:** Oh, no. Yeah. If you didn't know who Clown Charles was, look, it's hilarious.

**Tyler:** If you don't know who Clown Charles is, get off of YouTube if you're listening to this later and read Charles.

**Mark:** Okay, but if you're on YouTube, go to UniverseXYZ DAO and hit, like, and subscribe. Follow us. We have a sick YouTube channel. We post all our AMAs and our project calls. So get on that.

**Algy:** Faces. The polymorphic faces are going to be lit. So is Temple. So is Goblin Town. Yeah, the following ones will go into therapy.

**Mark:** Yeah, you guys don't even want to know that I'm not ready.

**Tyler:** All right, let's go back to it.

**Mark:** I think we're good if there are no more questions. Wait, hold on. There were some questions. 

### **Quesstion:**

What is the code? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Okay, it's **xyzrunner**, all lower case. Okay.

## Translate Calls and Docs & Education

**Mark:** Also Knowledgeable Idiot is going to start trying to get our calls and our docs transcribed into different languages. So if anybody has requests or specific languages that they'd like to see, one of the first ones that we'll focus on is Spanish because we think that there's not a ton of Spanish documentation on NFT tech. But, yeah, we're going to try and expand because NFT education is something that we're super focused on. I mean, not like focused on, but it's super important that we educate the masses and get good information. And if that means we need to translate our docs. We want to do that because we want to help and facilitate anybody in all cultures because NFTs are for everyone, and we want to be able to help and teach everyone about this. Are we all free to use the mint feature and create collections right now? Yeah, you can make any collection and mint on the Universe Contracts. They're up and working, and we will continue to add features to them, but they're safe to use as of right now. They're good, and they're immutable. They're sick.

Thank you for the question; team off.

**Algy:** We'll have other minting features. Any idea that you probably thought of? We probably thought of it, but drop it if you want other features for the minting; let us know what you want those to be.

**Mark:** Is it through the app? I don't think we have an app. So if you're using a Universe App, maybe send it to me because I don't think it's our app. Oh, the POAP.

Yeah. It'S through the POAP app. It's through POAP. But I think you have to DM the bot.

**Algy:** To find the bot.

**Mark:** You go to Universe category and then POAP claim. It looks like people are typing questions, so we'll extend this a little bit, we'll answer when Universe Marketplace sale of hopefully it's March 5 is the day Somnia probably has one of those high IQ brains, and that's why he asked good questions. Without question, Mark, that's a high IQ. People do. Someone's going to write history. It's going to be Somnia.

**Algy:** I met Somnia in real life I can confirm that he's chill.

**Mark:** Jump 22 is having trouble with the POAP. I didn't have any trouble. I was good to claim, so maybe you're doing something wrong, homie, but maybe DM Zach and Zach may be able to help you. I don't even think there are 50 people in here, so there's no way.

I think we're good. I think we're out of questions. So thank you, everyone, for coming and joining our space. Thank you for the questions. Thank you for taking the time to go and listen to us. We wish everyone a great week, and marketplace is going to be launched on March 5.

**Tyler:** We appreciate you, wild noodles.

**Mark:** Thank you, sir.

**Algy:** Bye. Bye. üëã

**Mark:** Bye, everyone. ‚úåÔ∏è
